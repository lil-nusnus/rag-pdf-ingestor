### The schedule for the live implementation of COCREE 2.0 is, as follows:

Live Implementation of COCREE 2.0 ### Type of BSFI : : Reporting Reporting Due Period Frequency Date U/KBs, subsidiary Ending Monthly TBs/NBQBs/ TCs of U/KBs, I 30 June 2024 and Digital Banks 25 banking days after Stand-alone Ending Monthly reference TBs/NBQBs/TCs 30 September 2024 reporting period RBs and Coop Banks Ending Quarterly 31 December 2024

To prepare and familiarize BSFls with the new requirement, the submission of COCEEE 2.0 will be open for pilot testing from January 2024 until its live implementation as scheduled in item no. 3. This will involve the iterative process of electronically submitting COCREE 2.0 test records to the BSP and addressing the exceptions noted in the BSP validation.

Only records of reporting periods prior to the scheduled live implementation but after the period ended 30 September 2023 can be used for pilot testing purposes. Records submitted during the pilot phase are primarily for testing purposes only and cannot be considered as live submission.

BSFls are strongly urged to capitalize on the opportunity to pilot test the reporting protocols and rules of COCREE 2.0 prior to its live implementation. The Compliance Officer (CO) of the BSFI interested to pilot test COCREE 2.0 in January 2024 can send an email to the CRSU at cocree@bsp.gov.ph to signify its interest. Within two (2) business days, the CO can expect an email reply from the CRSU that will explain the onboarding process and requirements.

To encourage BSFls to participate in the pilot test of COCREE 2.0, penalties for reporting violations of COCREE 2.0 shall not be imposed during the pilot testing period. Imposition of penalties for reporting violations of COCREE 2.0, however, shall be strictly enforced after the grace period of three (3) reporting periods from COCREE 2.0â€™s scheduled live implementation.

Penalties for reporting violations of the 2021 COCREE of U/KBs, their subsidiary TBs/NBQBs/TCs, and Digital Banks from reporting periods 31 July 2023 onwards shall also no longer apply as long as such violations are corrected and found compliant before the next reporting period becomes due or within the allowable period provided by the CRSU, as applicable.

Queries on the pilot test and/or clarifications about COCREE 2.0 can be referred to

the CRSU at (632) 5306-2561, (632) 5306-2721 and cocree@bsp.gov.ph. Other guidelines on the submission and validation process shall be issued separately.

For compliance and proper guidance. Digitally signed by .Chuchi G. Fonacier
