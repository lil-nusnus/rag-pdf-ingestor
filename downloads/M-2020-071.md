### OFFICE OF THE DEPUTY GOVERNOR ### FINANCIAL SUPERVISION SECTOR

### MEMORANDUM NO. M-2020-071

### TO : ALL BANKS AND NON-BANKS WITH QUASI-BANKING FUNCTIONS (NBQBs)

Subject : Collection of the Annual Supervisory Fees (ASF) for the Year 2020

Pursuant to Section 28 of the Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7653, “The New Central Bank Act”, as amended by R.A. No. 11211}, the following guidelines shall govern the computation and collection by the Bangko Sentral Ng Pilipinas (BSP) and the payment by Banks and NBQBs of the 2020 ASF.

1. Computation of ASF for 2020 The ASF is based on the Average Assessable Assets (AAA) of the

preceding year multiplied by the applicable assessment rates ### approved by the Monetary Board as follows:

Type of Financial Institution Applicable Rate Universal/Commercial Banks 1/28 of 1% Thrift Banks 1/28 of 1% Rural/Cooperative Banks 1/40 of 1% NBQBs 1/28 of 1%

The AAA of the preceding year is derived from the reports? submitted by the Bank/NBQB to the BSP in compliance with the standards and requirements prescribed under existing regulations.

In case of a merger or consolidation, the assets of the covered institutions prior to the merger or consolidation as well as the assets of the newly formed institution shall be considered in determining the AAA. In case of upgrading or downgrading, the assets from one bank category to another shall likewise be considered in determining the ### AAA.

1 Supervised institutions shall pay to Bangko Sentral no later than May 31 of each year, an annual supervision fee as may be prescribed by the Monetary Board (MB). For this year, the MB has approved the deferment of assessment and collection of the ASF from within the month of May 2020 to’a later date in 2020 in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.

? Financial Reporting Package {FRP) for banks, Consolidated Statement of Condition (CSOC) for NBOBs, and FRP for Trust Institution (FRPTI) of banks and NBQBs with trust functions

## Page 2

The collection of the 2020 ASF also takes into consideration events subsequent to the collection of the 2019 ASF that would warrant a recomputation. In such cases, the resulting over or under-payment of the 2019 ASF shall be deducted/added to the 2020 ASF.

Sample computations to illustrate potential scenarios are provided in Annex A.

. Notification of Amount Due for 2020 and Mode of Payment

The BSP Department of Supervisory Analytics (DSA) shall send a billing notice in September 2020 to the Bank/NBQB for its ASF payment indicating, among others, the computation of the ASF due, the period covered by the ASF and the specific date when the ASF will be debited from the Bank’s/NBQB’s Demand Deposit Account (DDA) with the BSP.

The BSP will not accept checks as mode of ASF payment. Banks/NBQBs, upon receipt of the ASF billing notice from the BSP, should maintain adequate balance in their DDA to cover the ASF and other daily obligations and, when necessary, make corresponding deposits to fully cover said obligations. In case of deficiency, the provisions on DDA deficiency in Section 1101 and Section 1101-Q of the Manual of Regulations for Banks (MORB) and Manual of Regulations for Non-Bank Financial Institutions (MORNBFI), respectively, as amended, shall apply.

Exemption of 2020 Supervisory Fees From Taxes

In accordance with the provision of R.A. No. 7653, as amended by R.A. No. 11211, the Bangko Sentral shall be exempt from all national, provincial, municipal and city taxes on income derived from its governmental functions which include income from its activities or transactions in the exercise of its supervision over the operations of banks and its regulatory and examination powers over non-bank financial institutions performing quasi-banking functions, money service businesses, credit granting businesses and payment systems operators. Such exemption from taxes includes the collection of the ASF, and as such, taxes should not be withheld by entities considered as Large Taxpayers by the Bureau of Internal Revenue.

. Exceptions Noted on Billing Notice of 2020 ASF

Upon receipt of the BSP Notice of ASF billing, a Bank/NBQB is encouraged to check the accuracy of the billing and to submit any of the noted exceptions therein not later than ten (10) working days before the specified date of collection/debit to DDA as indicated in the billing notice.

## Page 3

The said exceptions, together with supporting documents, shall be e-mailed to dsa-srog@bsp.gov.ph using the following prescribed subject format — ASF 2020-Noted Exceptions<space><BSF] Name>

For Example,

To : dsa-srog@bsp.gov.ph Subject : ASF 2020-Noted Exceptions <BSFi Name>

Any exceptions received after the cut-off date or any exceptions not duly substantiated with documents before the cut-off date will be evaluated and considered in the computation of the ASF for the immediately succeeding year.

This Memorandum shall take effect immediately.

For strict compliance. Digitally signed by . Chuchi G. Fonacier Date: 2020.09.24 14:42:47 +08'00' ### CHUCHI G. FONACIER Deputy Governor
