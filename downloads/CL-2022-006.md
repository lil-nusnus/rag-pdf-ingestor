### OFFICE OF THE DEPUTY GOVERNOR ### FINANCIAL SUPERVISION SECTOR

### CIRCULAR LETTER NO. CL-2022-006

To : ALL BSP-SUPERVISED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

Subject : Advisory on Coordination with BSP Account Officer/s

With the objective of effectively discharging the Financial Supervision Sector's (FSS) mandate, BSP-supervised financial institutions (BSFI) are assigned with dedicated account officer/s within the FSS. Accordingly, BSFls including their personnel are expected to directly coordinate with their respective account

officer/s to address their concerns appropriately and expeditiously.

However, it was noted that several queries on banking operations and/or regulations are transmitted to the BSP other than through BSFIâ€™s designated

account officer/s.

In this regard, BSFls are reminded to directly engage their respective

account officer/s within FSS to ensure that concerns are promptly addressed.

For guidance and consistent implementation. Digitally signed by , Chuchi G. Fonacier Date: 2022.01.17 10:06:12 +08'00' ### CHUCHI G. FONACIER Deputy Governor
