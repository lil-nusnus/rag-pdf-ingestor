Pursuant to Section 28 of the Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7653, “The New Central Bank Act”, as amended by R.A. No. 112111, the following guidelines shall govern the computation and collection by the Bangko Sentral Ng Pilipinas (BSP) and the payment by Banks and NBQBs of the 2021 ASF.

1. Computation of ASF for 2021 The ASF is based on the Average Assessable Assets (AAA) of the

preceding year multiplied by the applicable assessment rates ### approved by the Monetary Board as follows:

Type of Financial Institution Applicable Rate Universal/Commercial Banks 1/28 of 1% Thrift Banks 1/28 of 1% Rural/Cooperative Banks 1/40 of 1% NBQBs 1/28 of 1%

The AAA of the preceding year is derived from the reports? submitted by the Bank/NBQB to the BSP in compliance with the standards and requirements prescribed under existing regulations.

In case of a merger or consolidation, the assets of the covered institutions prior to the merger or consolidation as well as the assets of the newly formed institution shall be considered in determining the AAA. In case of upgrading or downgrading, the assets from one bank category to another shall likewise be considered in determining the ### AAA.

The collection of the 2021 ASF also takes into consideration events subsequent to the collection of the 2020 ASF that would warrant a

1 Supervised institutions shall pay to Bangko Sentral no later than May 31 of each year, an annual supervision fee as may be prescribed by the Monetary Board (MB).

recomputation. In such cases, the resulting over or under-payment of the 2020 ASF shall be deducted/added to the 2021 ASF.

Sample computations to illustrate potential scenarios are provided in Annex A.

Notification of Amount Due for 2021 and Mode of Payment

The BSP Department of Supervisory Analytics (DSA) shall send a billing notice in April 2021 to the Bank/NBQB for its ASF payment indicating, among others, the computation of the ASF due, the period covered by the ASF and the specific date when the ASF will be debited from the Bank’s/NBQB’s Demand Deposit Account (DDA) with the ### BSP.

The BSP will not accept checks as mode of ASF payment. Banks/NBQBs, upon receipt of the ASF billing notice from the BSP, should maintain adequate balance in their DDA to cover the ASF and other daily obligations and, when necessary, make corresponding deposits to fully cover said obligations. In case of deficiency, the provisions on DDA deficiency in Section 1101 and Section 1101-Q of the Manual of Regulations for Banks (MORB) and Manual of Regulations for Non-Bank Financial Institutions (MORNBFI), respectively, as amended, shall apply.

Exceptions Noted on Billing Notice of 2021 ASF

Upon receipt of the BSP Notice of ASF billing, a Bank/NBQB is encouraged to check the accuracy of the billing and to submit any of the noted exceptions therein not later than ten (10) working days before the specified date of collection/debit to DDA as indicated in the billing notice.

The said exceptions, together with supporting documents, shall be e-mailed to dsa-srog@bsp.gov.ph using the following prescribed subject format — ASF 2021-Noted Exceptions<space><BSFI Name>

For Example,

To : dsa-srog@bsp.gov.ph Subject : ASF 2021-Noted Exceptions <BSFl Name>

Any exceptions received after the cut-off date or any exceptions not duly substantiated with documents before the cut-off date will be evaluated and considered in the computation of the ASF for the immediately succeeding year.
