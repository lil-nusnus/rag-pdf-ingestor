### OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR

### CIRCULAR NO. _1127_ Series of 2021

Subject: Governance Policy for Operators of Payment System

The Monetary Board, in its Resolution No. 1240 dated 16 September 2021, approved the following governance guidelines for operators of a payment system (OPS).

Section 1. The following Sections shall be created in the Manual of Regulations ### for Payment Systems (MORPS):

204 Policy Statement. The Bangko Sentral recognizes that the OPS play an important role in sustaining the safe and efficient flow of payments including those arising from critical financial market transactions between and among banks and non-banking financial institutions, including cooperatives. Being generally responsible for interlinking these institutions that execute payment orders in their normal course of business, the OPS are also crucial in maintaining the public’s confidence in the financial system.

In this regard, the Bangko Sentral adopts the following governance policy which is aligned with the applicable Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMIs) recommended by the Committee of Payments and Settlement Systems of the Bank for International Settlements and the Technical Committee of the International Organization of Securities Commissions. These guidelines provide specific regulatory expectations in the application of certain principles in consideration of national conditions.

Scope and Applicability. This policy covers all registered OPS including the Bangko Sentral, being the operator of the real time gross settlement (RTGS) system). Other OPS include the (i.) Bangko Sentral-supervised financial institutions (BSFIs) which include banks and non-bank financial institutions (NBFls) such as non-bank electronic money issuers (EMI-NBFIs); and (ii.) non-BSFls such as cooperatives which are regulated by the Cooperative Development Authority (CDA), branches and subsidiaries of foreign incorporated entities as well as other domestic corporations and non-corporate entities, whose businesses are considered that of an OPS under existing Bangko Sentral regulations.

For BSFis

An OPS that has concurrent licenses such as a banking license or a license to be an EMI- NBFI shall adhere with the more stringent requirements between the guidelines in this policy and the applicable provisions of the Manual of Regulations for Banks (MORB) and the Manual of Regulations for Non-Bank Financial Institutions (MORNBFI) to be able to comply with the overall regulatory expectations of the Bangko Sentral.

The policy cross refers to certain governance standards under the MORB and the MORNEBFI since these requirements are also applicable to all OPS regardless of their concurrent authorities.

For branches or local subsidiaries of foreign incorporated OPS

An OPS, whose Head Office or Parent Company is under the jurisdiction of a foreign regulator, shall follow the more stringent requirements between the provisions of this policy and those prescribed by the relevant regulator in its home jurisdictions.

In case the requirements of the home regulator prevail, the governance arrangements being observed by the Head Office or Parent Company that are in accordance with the requirements of the relevant regulator in its home jurisdiction may be used as a means to comply with the Bangko Sentral’s policy. Proof of compliance with the requirements of the relevant regulator shall be made available upon request of the oversight department of the Bangko Sentral. Failure to submit proof of compliance with the requirements of the relevant regulator shall be deemed a violation of this provision and shall subject the OPS to appropriate enforcement actions under Bangko Sentral regulations.

In this context, a branch of a foreign incorporated OPS shall refer to any permanent office or place of business in the Philippines where an OPS may perform activities and provide products and services that are within the scope of its authority as an OPS, and of its other licenses, if any.

e.

(1) Approve policies for setting risk tolerance, defining risk appetite, and addressing crises that could threaten the viability of the payment system which the OPS operates. In pursuing so, the board shall take into account the OPS’ safety and efficiency objectives, business environment, regulatory landscape, long-term business interests, and risk management capability.

(2) Oversee the development of a risk appetite statement (RAS) and approve the same. The board shall ensure adherence to the statement, as well as compliance with risk limits and other risk management policies throughout the organization.

(3) Assign responsibilities and accountability for decisions that have a significant impact on the overall risk profile of the OPS, by adopting the three lines of defense framework. The business line functions will represent the first line of defense, the risk management and compliance functions as the second line of defense, and the internal audit function as the final line of defense.

In this regard, the board of directors shall ensure that the risk management, compliance, and internal audit functions have proper stature in the organization and have adequate staff and resources. The stature of these functions in the organization must enable them to carry out their responsibilities independently, objectively, and effectively.

The board shall ensure the OPS’ compliance with all supervisory and regulatory requirements. In relation to this, it shall establish an effective compliance risk management system that shall identify and mitigate risks arising from the OPS’ failure to comply with applicable laws, Bangko Sentral regulations, standards prescribed by the relevant payment system management body, and codes of conduct applicable to OPS’ activities.

The board shall ensure that the OPS’ business model, strategies, and activities appropriately take into account the legitimate interests of its participants and ### other relevant stakeholders. \n this regard, it shall:

(1) Consider the welfare of participants and relevant stakeholders in crafting major operational decisions involving the payment system’s design and overall business strategies. These decisions may involve the OPS operating structure, the scope of transactions processed, and the critical technology used in operations; and

(2) Establish clear processes for identifying and addressing stakeholders’ concerns and any conflict of interests between the stakeholders and the OPS.

Specific Duties and Responsibilities of a director. The position of a director is a position of trust which assumes fiduciary responsibilities for different stakeholders of the payment system. Hence, the members of the board of directors should exercise their “duty of care” and “duty of loyalty” to the OPS.

a.

To remain fit and proper for the position for the duration of his term. A director should possess unquestionable credibility to make decisions objectively and resist undue influence. He shall treat board directorship as a profession and shall have a clear understanding of his duties and responsibilities as well as his role in promoting good governance. Hence, he shall maintain his professional integrity

Page 15 of 29

## Page 16

and continuously seek to enhance his skills and knowledge through continuing education, training, and other learning opportunities. He should also have adequate understanding of the activities of the OPS, as well as the developments in the national payment system, the financial markets, and the broader financial system that may have implications for the safety and efficiency of the payment system where the OPS operates.

b. To act honestly and in good faith, with loyalty and in the best interest of the OPS, its stockholders, and other stakeholders such as the end-users of the payment system and the general public. A director must always act in good faith, with the care which a prudent man would exercise under similar circumstances. While a director should always strive to promote the interest of all stockholders, he should also give due regard to the rights and interests of other stakeholders.

c. To have a working knowledge of the statutory and regulatory requirements affecting the institution. A director should be knowledgeable of the regulations of the Bangko Sentral, the provisions of the NPSA, and where applicable, the requirements of other relevant regulatory agencies. A director should also keep himself informed of financial system developments and payment system trends and relevant international standards in order to safeguard the interest of the OPS.

In addition, a director of an OPS shall have the duties and responsibilities of a director enumerated as items “b”, “d”, “e”, “f’, “g” and “i” in Sections 132/132-Q of the MORB/MORNBFI (Specific duties and responsibilities of a director).

207 Board-Level Committees. The board of directors may delegate some of its functions, ### but not its responsibilities, to board-level committees. In this regard, the board shall:

a. Approve, review, and update at least annually or whenever there are significant changes to the charter of each committee or other governance arrangements that set out a committee’s mandate, scope of function, and working arrangements. These arrangements shall articulate how the committee will report to the board of directors, what the committee members are expected to deliver, and how long a member may serve the committee. The board shall also consider occasional rotation of committee members and chairs to avoid undue concentration of power and promote fresh perspective.

b. Appoint members of the committees, considering the optimal mix of skills and experiences to allow the board of directors, through the committees, to fully understand and objectively evaluate relevant issues. To promote objectivity, the board shall appoint independent directors and non-executive members of the board. Towards this end, an independent director who is a member of any committee that exercises executive or management functions which can potentially impair such director's independence cannot accept membership in committees that perform independent oversight/control functions such as the Audit, Risk Oversight, or Corporate Governance Committee without prior approval of the Monetary Board.

In the case of a cooperative, the Audit Committee members that meet the qualifications stated in this policy shall be elected by the cooperative’s General Assembly pursuant to R.A. No. 9520.

c. Ensure that each committee maintains appropriate records (e.g., minutes of Page 16 of 29

## Page 17

meetings or summary of matters reviewed and decisions taken) of their deliberations and decisions. Such records shall document the committee's fulfillment of its responsibilities and facilitate the assessment of the performance of the committee’s functions.

d. Form an Audit Committee unless directed by the Bangko Sentral to create other board-level committees (i.e., Risk Oversight or Corporate Governance Committee) such as the case for Operators of Designated Payment Systems (ODPS)under Section 211. Provided, that the board of directors shall discuss risk management and corporate governance matters in its meetings, with the views of the independent director/s, in addition to those of the other directors, duly considered and minuted.

In complying with this provision, OPS that are branches or locally incorporated subsidiaries of foreign incorporated OPS may resort to the global or regional board-level committees formed by their Head Office or Parent Company. Hence, these OPS need not form their own local board and board-level committees to comply with this provision. However, depending on the nature, scale and complexity of their local businesses they may be required by the Bangko Sentral to form local management committees to oversee risk management, internal control, compliance and strategic concerns emanating from their local operations.

Audit Committee

a. Composition and chairperson. The audit committee of an OPS shall be composed of at least three (3) members of the board of directors who shall all be non- executive directors, including the chairperson who shall be an independent director.

The audit committee shall have expertise in payment system operations, internal control frameworks, accounting, auditing, or related financial management expertise or relevant experiences commensurate with the size, systemic importance, operational complexity, and risk profile of the OPS. The committee shall have access to independent experts who can assist in carrying out the committee's responsibilities.

To ensure the effectiveness of the internal audit function, the committee shall deploy sufficient audit human resource and accord the auditors the independence necessary to enable them to provide rigorous assessment on the quality of risk management and control processes. The committee shall functionally meet

Page 17 of 29

## Page 18

with the head of the internal audit function, or with equivalent personnel in case the internal audit function is outsourced, and their meetings shall be duly minuted and adequately documented.

(3) Oversee the external audit function. The committee shall be responsible for the appointment, performance evaluation, and replacement of the external auditor, including approval of fees to this auditor. It shall review and approve the audit engagement contract and ensure that the audit, at a minimum, covers the areas which are specifically prescribed by the Bangko Sentral and other regulators.

(4) Establish whistleblowing mechanism. The committee shall establish and maintain mechanisms by which officers and staff shall, in confidence, raise concerns to persons or entities that have the power to take corrective actions on possible improprieties or malpractices in the areas of payment system operations, financial reporting, internal control, and audit, or other issues. The committee shall also ensure that arrangements are in place for the independent investigation, appropriate follow-up action, and subsequent resolution of complaints.
