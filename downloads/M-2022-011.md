### MEMORANDUM NO. M-2022-O01]

### OFFICE OF THE DEPUTY GOVERNOR ### FINANCIAL SUPERVISION SECTOR

To : ALL BANKS AND NON-BANKS WITH QUASI-BANKING FUNCTIONS (NBQBs)

Subject : Collection of the Annual Supervisory Fees (ASF) for the Year 2022

Pursuant to Section 28 of the Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7653, “The New Central Bank Act”, as amended by R.A. No. 11211, the following guidelines shall govern the computation and collection by the Bangko Sentral Ng Pilipinas (BSP) and the payment by Banks and NBQBs of the 2022 ASF.

1. Computation of ASF for 2022 The ASF is based on the Average Assessable Assets (AAA) of the

preceding year multiplied by the applicable assessment rates ### approved by the Monetary Board as follows:

Type of Financial Institution Applicable Rate Universal/Commercial Banks 1/28 of 1% Thrift Banks 1/28 of 1% Rural/Cooperative Banks 1/40 of 1% NBQBs 1/28 of 1%

The AAA of the preceding year is derived from the reports! submitted by the Bank/NBQB to the BSP in compliance with the standards and_ requirements’ prescribed under existing regulations. Pursuant to Memorandum No. M-2021-065 dated 23 November 2021”, the ASF of banks for the years 2022 and 2023 shall be reduced by deducting the average amount of basic deposit account (BDA) maintained by the bank in the preceding year from the Bank’s AAA. For this purpose, the average amount of BDA maintained in the preceding year will be computed based on the bank’s BDA balance as of quarter-end reporting period and adjusted by a multiplier of 5.

## Page 2

In case of a merger or consolidation, the assets of the covered institutions prior to the merger or consolidation as well as the assets of the newly formed institution shall be considered in determining the AAA. In case of upgrading or downgrading, the assets from one bank category to another shall likewise be considered in determining the AAA.

The collection of the 2022 ASF also takes into consideration events subsequent to the collection of the 2021 ASF that would warrant a recomputation. In such cases, the resulting over or under-payment of the 2021 ASF shall be deducted/added to the ### 2022 ASF.

Sample computations to illustrate potential scenarios are provided in Annex A.

Notification of Amount Due for 2022 and Mode of Payment

The BSP Department of Supervisory Analytics (DSA) shall send a billing notice in April 2022 to the Bank/NBQB for its ASF payment indicating, among others, the computation of the ASF due, the period covered by the ASF and the specific date when the ASF will be debited from the Bank’s/NBQB’s Demand Deposit Account (DDA) with the BSP.

The BSP will not accept checks as mode of ASF payment. Banks/NBQBs, upon receipt of the ASF billing notice from the BSP, should maintain adequate balance in their DDA to cover the ASF and other daily obligations and, when necessary, make corresponding deposits to fully cover said obligations. In case of deficiency, the provisions on DDA deficiency in Section 1101 and Section 1101-Q of the Manual of Regulations for Banks (MORB) and Manual of Regulations for Non-Bank Financial Institutions (MORNBEFI), respectively, as amended, shall apply.

Exceptions Noted on Billing Notice of 2022 ASF

Upon receipt of the BSP Notice of ASF billing, a Bank/NBQB is encouraged to check the accuracy of the billing and to submit any of the noted exceptions therein not later than ten (10) working days before the specified date of collection/debit to DDA as indicated in the billing notice.

The said exceptions, together with supporting documents, shall be e-mailed to dsa-srog@bsp.gov.ph using the _ following prescribed subject format - ASF 2022-Noted Exceptions<space><BSFI Name>

Any exceptions received after the cut-off date or any exceptions not duly substantiated with documents before the cut- off date will be evaluated and considered in the computation of the ASF for the immediately succeeding year.

This Memorandum shall take effect immediately.

2. Consolidation: Two or more entities combine to form a new single entity. The original entities cease operations after

the new entity started its operations.

Scenario E: RB C and TB C consolidated in January 2022 to form a new TB D.

Since the consolidation was effected prior to the assessment for 2022 ASF, the 2021 Net Assessable Assets

of the two banks will be combined and the TB rate will be applied.
