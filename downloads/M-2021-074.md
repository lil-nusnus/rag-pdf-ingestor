BSFls are likewise urged to re-assess their existing controls in detecting or preventing the possible massive influx of fraudulent accounts and transactions.

At the minimum, BSFls should consider the following possible scenarios in calibrating their FMS and account and_ transaction monitoring ### rules/parameters:
