Only records of reporting periods prior to the scheduled live implementation but after period ended 30 June 2024 can be used for pilot testing purposes. Records submitted during the pilot phase are for testing purposes only. Pilot testing of the entire COCREE 2.0 data set is urged to optimize the benefits of the pilot exercise. A subset of the entire COCREE 2.0 data set is however permissible during the pilot phase with the understanding that it represents a substantial portion of the actual data points and fields for testing. The use of dummy data is highly discouraged.

Submission of the 2021 COCREE (or COCREE 1.0) of U/KBs, their subsidiary TBs/NBQBs/TCs, and DGBs shall continue but will no longer be required only upon live implementation of COCREE 2.0. Penalties for reporting violations of COCREE 1.0 shall no longer apply as long as such violations are corrected and found compliant before the next reporting period becomes due or within the allowable period provided by the CRSU, as applicable.

Penalties for reporting violations of COCREE 2.0 shall not be imposed during the pilot testing phase but will be strictly enforced after the grace period of three (3) reporting periods from the start of the live implementation. Only BSFls that are actively participating in the pilot test in accordance with the provisions of item 3 shall be eligible for the grace period.

Queries on the pilot test and/or clarifications about COCREE 2.0, can be

referred to CRSU at (632) 5306-256], (632) 5306-3128 and cocree@bsp.gov.ph.
