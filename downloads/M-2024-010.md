### OFFICE OF THE DEPUTY GOVERNOR I FINANCIAL SUPERVISION SECTOR

### MEMORANDUM NO. M-2024-010

To : All Banks and Non-Banks with Quasi-Banking Functions (NBQBs)

Subject : Collection of the Annual Supervision Fees (ASF) for the Year 2024

Pursuant to Section 28 of the Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7653, ‘The New Central Bank Act”, as amended by R.A. No. 11211, the following guidelines shall govern the computation and collection by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) and the payment of the 2024 ASF by no later than May 31 of each year.

1. Computation of ASF for 2024! The ASF is based on the Average Assessable Assets (AAA) of the

preceding year multiplied by the applicable assessment rates approved ### by the Monetary Board as follows:

Type of Financial Institution Applicable Rate Universal/ Commercial Banks 1/28 of 1% Digital Banks 1/28 of 1% Thrift Banks 1/28 of 1% Rural/ Cooperative Banks 1/40 of 1% NBQBs 1/28 of 1%

The AAA of the preceding year is derived from the reports? submitted by the Bank/NBQB to the BSP in compliance with the standards and requirements prescribed under existing regulations. For this purpose, the ASF shall be computed based on the bank's “Total Assessable Assets”, which shall refer to total assets (end- of-month total assets per balance sheet, after deducting cash on hand, amounts due from banks, including the BSP and banks abroad?, and investment in national government (NG) securities (Annex A)), plus assets under management of the Trust Department of a bank. Further, the ASF of NBQBs shall be computed based on the NBQB’s ‘Total Assessable Assets”, which shall refer to total assets (end-of-quarter total assets per balance sheet, after deducting cash on hand, amounts due from banks, including the BSP and banks abroad, and investment in NG securities (Annex A)), plus assets under management of the Trust Department of a non-bank with quasi-banking license.

3 Including Central banks and monetary authorities of other jurisdictions

Classification: GENERAL

The regulatory incentive for early adoption of the Standard Business Loan Application Form by covered entities under Circular No. 1156 dated 30 September 2022 shall be in the form of a reduction in the ASF for each of the years 2024 and 2025. The reduction shall be equivalent to twenty percent of the assessed ASF or Php 2.0 million, whichever is lower.

In case of a merger or consolidation, the assets of the covered institutions prior to the merger or consolidation as well as the assets of the newly formed institution shall be considered in determining the AAA. In case of upgrading or downgrading, the assets from one bank category to another shall likewise be considered in determining the AAA.

The collection of the 2024 ASF also takes into consideration events subsequent to the collection of the 2023 ASF that would warrant a recomputation. In such cases, the resulting over or under-payment of last year ASF shall be deducted/added to this year’s ### ASF.

Sample computations to illustrate potential scenarios are provided in Annex B.

Notification of Amount Due for 2024 and Mode of Payments

The BSP Department of Supervisory Analytics (DSA) shall send a billing notice in April 2024 to the Bank/NBQB for its ASF payment indicating, among others, the computation of the ASF due, the period covered by the ASF and the specific date when the ASF will be debited from the Bank’s/NBQB’s Demand Deposit Account (DDA) with the BSP.

Banks/NBQBs, upon receipt of the ASF billing notice from the BSP, should maintain adequate balance in their DDA to cover the ASF and other daily obligations and, when necessary, make corresponding deposits to fully cover said obligations. In case of deficiency, the provisions on DDA deficiency in Section 1101 and Section 1101-Q of the Manual of Regulations for Banks (MORB) and Manual of Regulations for Non-Bank Financial Institutions (MORNBEFI), respectively, as amended, shall apply.

Exceptions Noted on Billing Notice of 2024 ASF

Upon receipt of the BSP Notice of ASF billing, a Bank/NBQB is encouraged to check the accuracy of the billing and to submit any of the noted exceptions therein not later than ten (10) working days before the specified date of collection/debit to DDA as indicated in the billing notice.

The said exceptions, together with supporting documents, shall be

e-mailed to dsa-srog@bsp.gov.ph using the following prescribed subject format - ASF 2024 -Noted Exceptions<space><BSFI Name>

immediately succeeding year.

4. Amendment of reports used in the computation of ASF

Scenario I: RB E amended its Dec 2022 FRP in January 2024

The 2023 ASF will be recomputed and the resulting under/(over) collection will be added to/deducted from the 2024 ASF.

Inclusion of the regulatory Standard Business Loan Application Form (SBLAF) incentive as a reduction in the computation of the ASF.

Reduction should be equivalent to twenty percent (20%) of the assessed ASF or Two Million Pesos, whichever is lower.
