### CIRCULAR LETTER NO. CL-2023-_069

To : All BSP-Supervised Financial Institutions (BSFIs)

Subject : Money Laundering/Terrorism Financing National Risk Assessment

Under Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 37' dated 16 October 2023 (Annex A), the Office of the President directed the urgent implementation of the National Anti-Money Laundering, Counter-Terrorism Financing, and Counter-Proliferation Financing Strategy 2023-2027 and enjoined all concerned agencies to fully support and actively participate in the conduct of the Money Laundering/Terrorism Financing (ML/TF) National Risk Assessment (NRA).

The NRA is an integral component of the Philippines’ efforts to combat ML/TF and other related threats to the integrity of the international financial system. In line with this, the NRA is critical in maintaining an updated understanding of the ML/TF environment and risk posture of the country. The results of the NRA will inform the supervising authorities, other law enforcement agencies, and covered persons in the efficient allocation of resources and implementation of risk-based measures in preventing or mitigating ML/TF risks.

The NRA involves the use of both quantitative and qualitative data/information gathered from reports and other relevant sources. Accordingly, the BSP, in conducting the NRA for the banking sector and other financial institutions under its supervision, shall gather relevant data and information to facilitate the identification, evaluation and assessment. Further, representatives from the private sector will also be invited to provide valuable industry and business insights in the NRA process.

In this regard, we enjoin the BSFls’ active participation for the successful conduct of

this NRA exercise. I Digitally signed by enn Ma. Belinda G. Caraan Date: 2023.12.27 20:47:07 +08'00'
