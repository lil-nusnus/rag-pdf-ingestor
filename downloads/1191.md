### FOREWORD

As the Bangko Sentral takes strategic strides toward payment system reforms in alignment with international standards and best practices, it has become imperative that the regulatory issuances on payments are readily available to guide these reforms. This Manual of Regulations for Payment Systems (MORPS) is therefore designed to systematically organize the various policy and regulatory issuances enforced by the Bangko Sentral. These issuances implement the broader provisions of Republic Act No. 11127 or the National Payment Systems Act in conjunction with other pertinent laws governing payment systems.

The MORPS is primarily designed to foster adherence by operators of payment systems (OPS) to standards that are aimed at fortifying the safety, efficiency, and reliability of the national payment system. Its significance, however, extends beyond OPS as it serves as

‘an invaluable reference for any individual, institution, or agency with an active interest in , the national payment landscape.

This edition encapsulates the cumulative compilation of rules and regulations issued as of end-December 2023.

### 101 PAYMENT SYSTEM OVERSIGHT FRAMEWORK

101.1 Policy Statement. A safe and efficient national payment system is crucial to the smooth functioning of financial markets and the stability of monetary and financial systems. It is also instrumental in achieving and sustaining inclusive economic growth. Thus, the Bangko Sentral adopts this oversight framework for the effective and efficient governance of the national payment system (NPS).

101.2 Objectives of the Oversight Function. The Bangko Sentral performs oversight functions primarily to ensure safety, efficiency, and reliability of the NPS.

Safety builds and preserves confidence in the financial system. This objective requires reliability and integrity of the payment system as well as effective management of a broad spectrum of payment-related risks such as legal, compliance, credit, liquidity, business, custody, investment and operational risks, including cybersecurity breaches, operational and settlement failures, and fraudulent transactions.

Efficiency is characterized by the presence of quick and affordable payment means which are fit for the purpose of the transactions and the needs of the users and the participants. Interoperability and healthy competition among the Payment Service Providers (PSPs) and the Operators of a Payment System (OPSs) are necessary to achieve efficiency.

101.3 Responsibility for Oversight. Pursuant to the authority granted under Section 5 of R.A. No. 11127 or the NPSA and Section 3 of R.A. No. 7653 or The New Central Bank Act as amended by R.A. No. 11211, the Bangko Sentral, through an appropriate oversight department, is responsible for overseeing the NPS, including the payment system that the Bangko Sentral owns and operates pursuant to Section 8 of R.A. No. 11127. The Bangko Sentral shall adopt internal safeguards to ensure independence between its overseer and operator functions.

101.4 Cooperative Oversight. With regard to payment activities and interlinkages of Financial Market Infrastructures (FMIs) that relate or interconnect with payment systems, the Bangko Sentral shall pursue cooperative oversight with relevant local regulators, government agencies, and foreign regulators. Apart from enhancing oversight capacity and response, cooperative oversight prevents regulatory arbitrage resulting from gaps, inefficiencies, duplications, and inconsistencies in the regulations for FMls. In this respect, the Bangko Sentral shall establish measures to facilitate effective and efficient flow of information among various regulators and government agencies. The cooperation and information-sharing process shall be compliant with relevant statutory provisions and consistent with the responsibilities for authorities under the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI).'

a. Other local regulators and government agencies. The Bangko Sentral shall coordinate with other regulators including primary regulators of FMls, that relate to or interconnect with payment systems. The grant, suspension, or revocation of any government license necessary for the conduct of business of an OPS must be

1 International standards for financial market infrastructures, i.e, payment systems, central securities depositories, securities settlement systems, central counterparties and trade repositories, issued by the CPMI and the lIOSCO.

done only with prior consultation with the Bangko Sentral,” being the primary regulator of the OPS.

b. Foreign regulators or overseers of payment systems of other countries. The Bangko Sentral’s cooperative oversight shall conform to the arrangements entered into by the Philippines through regional and global affiliations such as, but not limited to, the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia and Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP}, South East Asian Central Banks (SEACEN), and Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN). In cases where a payment system participant in the Philippines also operates in other jurisdictions, or a domestic payment system interacts with FMIs in other countries, the Bangko Sentral can directly coordinate with foreign regulators or overseers of payment systems. The coordination aims to facilitate safe, efficient, and reliable cross-border payment transactions.

101.5 Scope of Oversight. The oversight function of the Bangko Sentral shall cover the

### NPS including activities of the following institutions:

a. Operators of payment systems (OPS) All OPS shall comply with the relevant regulations and guidelines set out by the Bangko Sentral, including governance, risk management and reporting requirements. An OPS shall remain financially and technically capable to ensure that the payment system it operates remains robust and responsive to the needs of its participants.

b. Financial Market Infrastructures (FM/) The Bangko Sentral focuses its oversight on the NPS. Cooperative oversight shall be pursued by the Bangko Sentral for payment activities and interlinkages of other FMls that relate to or interconnect with payment systems. Payment system FMls, at the minimum, shall observe the relevant PFMI and comply with applicable Bangko Sentral rules and regulations. PFMI assessment responsibilities for other FMls shall be subject of cooperative oversight with the FMI’s primary regulator. Likewise, the oversight function shall extend to the payment and settlement activities of correspondent banks and custodians.

c. Payment System Management Body (PSMB) A PSMB, duly accredited by the Monetary Board, shall be responsible for promoting the development and interoperability of the payment system, the creation of payment system rules and agreements, and the establishment of standards to ensure that payment transactions are safely and efficiently cleared and settled with finality; provided, that the said rules, agreements, and standards shall be subject to review and prior approval by the Bangko Sentral. The PSMB shall develop a comprehensive and holistic governance framework that satisfactorily demonstrates how the PSMB will perform self-regulation among its members in accordance with the NPSA. The PSMB shall establish policies and procedures to implement the governance framework, including assurance measures for members’ compliance with the PSMB rules and regulations, to instill discipline among its members and to promote development of the payment system. The development and implementation of the framework, policies and procedures by the PSMB shall be subject of oversight by the Bangko Sentral. The Bangko Sentral may accredit several PSMBs. Conversely, the Bangko Sentral may revoke the accreditation of a PSMB for failure to perform its function or when it no longer serves its purpose as a PSMB.

d. Payment service providers (PSPs) PSPs shall ensure that the payment instruments and delivery channels they offer are responsive to the needs of the end-users and compliant with relevant regulatory requirements, including, but not limited to, payment regulations, consumer protection, information security, and anti-money laundering/combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT).

e. Critical Service Provider (CSP) ofa designated payment system. The Bangko Sentral shall exercise its oversight function over the CSPs of DPS. The Bangko Sentral may engage in a cooperative oversight with the primary regulator of a CSP that operates not only in the Philippines but also in other jurisdictions. At the minimum, CSPs shall observe the relevant principles for CSPs as provided in the PFMI.

101.6 Oversight Activities. Consistent with a risk-based approach that takes into consideration both the payment system’s risk profile and its impact in the NPS, the ### Bangko Sentral shall perform the following oversight activities:

a. Monitoring existing and planned payment systems. The Bangko Sentral monitors existing and planned payment systems to obtain an in-depth knowledge of the interaction among payment systems and the interlinkages between payment systems and other FMIls. By monitoring payment systems, the Bangko Sentral aims to ultimately determine the impact of these systems on the broader financial and monetary systems. Relative to this activity, the Bangko Sentral adopts the ### following policies:

(1) Registration and licensing. The Bangko Sentral requires registration of all OPS in accordance with the guidelines provided under Section 502 of the MORPS. A registered OPS that intends to operate within a designated payment system shall secure prior approval from the Bangko Sentral.° The licensing framework under the MORPS shall include, at a minimum, the requirements for PSPs, ODPS, and payment services, arrangements, instruments, and activities.

(2) Off-site monitoring. The Bangko Sentral shall require the participants of payment systems to submit periodic and ad hoc reports on payment and other financial transactions, key risk indicators, incidents, and other statistics, key documents, and information relevant to its oversight of the NPS. The submission of the required reports to the appropriate oversight department shall conform to the reporting governance framework of the Bangko Sentral. As deemed relevant, the Bangko Sentral shall conduct meetings with existing and/or prospective participants of a payment system.

(3) On-site activities. The Bangko Sentral shall perform on-site activities which shall complement off-site activities to strengthen the oversight of the NPS. The appropriate oversight department shall determine the frequency and scope of on-site activities. These activities shall include, but are not limited to, review of contractual arrangements governing payment systems, evaluation of pricing mechanisms against the principles adopted by the Bangko Sentral, verification of compliance with relevant laws, regulations and policies, and validation of representations made by the participants in the payment systems.

* The Bangko Sentral‘s oversight activities are consistent with those provided in the “Central Bank Oversight of Payment and Settlement Systems” issued by the CPMI. 5 Pursuant to R.A. 11127, operators of designated payment systems are required to secure prior authority from the Bangko Sentral

Page 3 of 71

## Page 14

b. Assessing the NPS and payment systems against the safety, efficiency and reliability objectives. In pursuit of these objectives, the Bangko Sentral conducts continuous assessment of payment systems and the NPS based on information gathered from its monitoring activities. The Bangko Sentral adopts the following ### policies in connection with this activity:

(1) Internationally Accepted Standards and Practices (IASPs)} \ASPs are established, thoroughly-developed, and _ generally-accepted guidance prescribed by reputable international-standard setting bodies, which include multilateral agencies.° The Bangko Sentral shall require the observance of IIASPs in the design and operation of payment systems.

(2) Assessment Criteria. The Bangko Sentral shall adopt different sets of assessment criteria in consideration of the characteristics and risk profile of payment systems, the size and profile of the transactions these systems process, and the system architecture, governance and controls, among others, established by the participants in the payment systems.

(3) Designation. The Bangko Sentral shall designate a payment system which poses or has the potential to pose systemic risk that could threaten the stability of the NPS. To protect public interest, the Bangko Sentral may also designate a payment system which may not trigger or transmit systemic risk but could have a Major economic impact or undermine the confidence of the public in the NPS or in the currency in general. Designation shall conform to the criteria and the process provided in this framework.

(4) Enforcement action. The Bangko Sentral may deploy enforcement actions, including but not limited to monetary and/or administrative penalties and sanctions, to ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulation and bring about timely corrective actions. Any violation committed by an OPS or any other participant in a payment system, and/or by their directors and officers, shall be subject to the sanctions set forth in Sections 36 and 37 of R.A. No. 7653, as amended, and Sections 19 and 20 of R.A. No. 11127, as appropriate.

c. Inducing Change. The Bangko Sentral acts as a catalyst for change to pursue development and innovation of payment systems, enhance the safety and efficiency of the NPS, as well as address emerging payment risks or issues. The Bangko Sentral may pursue its reform agenda in several ways, such as, but not ### limited to, the following means:

(1) Stakeholder dialogue. The Bangko Sentral may regularly conduct dialogues and collaborate with key stakeholders on innovative approaches towards improving the payment system to ensure that oversight expectations are consistent with industry initiatives and the needs of the end users. Towards this end, a formal forum, led by the Bangko Sentral with key stakeholders as regular members, may be created. Further, the Bangko Sentral shall conduct focused research and, as suitable, collaborate with other local and/or foreign regulators on payments development in the country. Joint actions or projects can be pursued for this purpose.

6 Examples include: The World Bank (WB), and the BIS Page 4 of 71

## Page 15

(2) Policy issuance. The Bangko Sentral shall issue policies to enable innovative solutions for the payment systems to thrive while keeping the existing and emerging payment-related risks adequately managed and mitigated. These policies shall include principles and requirements on various areas, such as, but not limited to governance, risk management, consumer protection, data confidentiality, information security, AML/CFT, and pricing mechanism.

101.7 Designation of a Payment System. A payment system shall be designated as SIPS or PIPS upon determination by the Bangko Sentral that the payment system poses or has the potential to pose systemic risk, or the designation of the payment system is necessary to protect public interest. The Bangko Sentral shall take into account the following criteria and any other relevant considerations approved by the ### Monetary Board for the purpose of designating payment systems:

Market share;

Aggregate settlement risk based on volume and value of transactions;

Nature and complexity of transactions that the system processes; Interdependence with other payment systems or FMls; and

Absence of alternative payment system.

9anoo

101.8 Designation. Vetting on the designation of a payment system shall be based, among others, on information gathered from offsite monitoring, stakeholder dialogue, on-site activities, and cooperative oversight. Once the designation criteria are met, the Bangko Sentral shall initiate a focused review on the payment system’s profile, including its current and potential impact on the NPS. In the course of the assessment, the Bangko Sentral shall engage the participants of the payment system being evaluated for possible designation.

Upon approval of the designation of a payment system, the Bangko Sentral shall notify the participants of the payment system. A transitory provision for compliance with the requirements for a designated payment system shall be included in the notification, as applicable. Moreover, the Bangko Sentral shall inform the public of the designation of a payment system.

101.9 Designated Payment System (DPS). Participants of DPS shall be subject to periodic assessment by the Bangko Sentral. The assessment shall be comprised of on- site visits and off-site monitoring activities. Assessments shall focus on the observance of standards such as the PFMI and other IASPs, compliance of participants in the DPS with laws, regulations, and determination of whether the factors considered for designation continue to exist. The participants in a DPS shall demonstrate adequate governance and risk management arrangements consistent with the principles set out in relevant laws and regulations. These arrangements cover several areas of concern including the access of participants to the system, management of liquidity, credit, operational, settlement and general business risks, finality of settlement, fair market competition, reasonable pricing mechanism, independent assurance/audit, and transparency.

101.10 Operator of a Designated Payment System (ODPS). Recognizing the role assumed by an operator in the maintenance and operation of a designated payment system, the Bangko Sentral, through the Monetary Board, shall set the organizational and operational requirements for an ODPS.

### 102 ADOPTION OF THE PRINCIPLES FOR FINANCIAL MARKET ### INFRASTRUCTURES (PFMI)®

102.1 Policy Statement. I\n line with the thrust of ensuring the safety, efficiency, and reliability of the national payment system (NPS), the Bangko Sentral shall require the adoption of the PFMI standard by the designated payment systems (DPS), pursuant to the Payment System Oversight Framework (PSOF), and the National Payment Systems Act (NPSA). In cases involving non-payment system financial market infrastructures (FMIs) and cross-border payment systems, adoption of the PFMI may be subject of cooperative arrangements? with other regulatory authorities.

102.2 Scope. The mandatory adoption of the PFMI standard shall be required for DPS, including its participants’, to the extent of the role/s being performed by said participants in the DPS. Aligned with this, the Bangko Sentral shall use the PFMI assessment methodology to determine the observance of relevant principles by the DPS as well as identify possible risks and induce changes in the NPS. For non- designated payment systems, the Bangko Sentral may utilize applicable key considerations under relevant principles of said Standard to assess the practices in the design and operations of said payment systems. For cross-border payment system, in case the requirements under Bangko Sentral regulations or PFMI are not applied by the foreign overseer/authority in its home jurisdiction, said regulations or principles may still be required by the Bangko Sentral as deemed necessary and consistent with the authority granted to the Bangko Sentral over its registered and licensed institutions. The coordination with foreign regulators shall aim to facilitate safe, efficient, and reliable cross- border payment transactions."

102.3 Relevant Principles. Tne PFMI is a set of international standards designed to strengthen FMIis and make them more resilient to financial crises, and participant defaults. In general, while the standards are principles-based, said standards

8 International standards for FMls, i.e., payment systems, central securities depositories, securities settlement systems, central counterparties and trade repositories, issued by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO)

° Section 9 of the NPSA Coordination with Other Government Agencies and Foreign Regulators: and as provided in the ### PSOF.

10 As defined under the NPSA. participants include operator. issuer, service provider or any person involved in the payment system other than the end-user

As provided under cooperative oversight section of the PSOF.

## Page 18

incorporate, in some cases, specific minimum requirements to achieve the same base level of risk management across different FMIs and countries.’

While the PFMI consists of twenty-four (24) principles, the required adoption by the DPS shall at a minimum extend to principles relevant to payment systems in the country, as provided in Appendix 102-1. These principles shall be applied holistically and not on a stand-alone basis given that some principles are built upon others while some complement others. The principles are classified into eight (8) broad categories, ### namely:

a. General organization - Principles under this category provide guidance on how the DPS shall generally be organized to establish a strong foundation for the comprehensive management of risks in the DPS. This covers principles on legal basis, governance, and risk management framework.

b. Credit and liquidity risk management - Principles under this category provide standards to support a high degree of confidence that the DPS will be able to operate and serve as a source of financial stability even under stressful conditions.

c. Settlement - Principles under this category require the DPS to address issues on settlement risk and finality of DPS transactions.

d. Default management- This principle requires the adoption of appropriate policies, rules, and procedures in the DPS to manage default of participant/s.

e. General business risk and operational risk management - Principles under this category are designed to: (1) protect participants and the financial system from the risk that a DPS could suddenly cease operations as a result of business losses unrelated to participant defaults; and (2) strengthen the requirements on operational reliability and resilience.

f. Access - Principles under this category address management of risks posed by alternative access arrangements and the need for fair and open access to the DPS.

g. Efficiency - Principles under this category enable the DPS to be efficient and effective in meeting the requirements of its participants and the market it serves.

h. Transparency - Principles under this category require that relevant information shall be provided to the participants of the DPS, the authorities, and the public to enable informed and sound decision making as well as foster confidence in the market it serves.

102.4 Adoption by DPS. The adoption of the applicable principles by the DPS shall depend on whether it is designated as a systemically important payment system (SIPS) or prominently important payment system (PIPS). Appendix 102-1 provides which principles shall be adopted by a SIPS or PIPS."

102.5 Critical Service Providers (CSPs). I\n certain cases, the operational reliability of a DPS may be dependent on the performance of service providers that are critical to its operations, such as information technology and messaging providers. In this respect, ### the Bangko Sentral sets forth the following expectations” to be met by CSPs:

a. Risk identification and management - A CSP is expected to identify and manage relevant operational and financial risks to its critical services and ensure that its risk management processes are effective.

b. /nformation Security- A CSP is expected to implement and maintain appropriate policies and procedures, and devote sufficient resources to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of information and the availability of its critical

services in order to fulfill the terms of its relationship with the Operator of a Designated Payment System (ODPS)'"> or the DPS.

c. Reliability and resilience - A CSP is expected to implement appropriate policies and procedures, and devote sufficient resources to ensure that its critical services are available, reliable and resilient. Its business continuity management and disaster recovery plans should therefore support the timely resumptions of its critical services in the event of an outage so that the service provided fulfills the terms of its agreement with the ODPS/DPS.

d. Technology planning - The CSP is expected to have in place robust methods to plan for the entire lifecycle of the use of technologies and the selection of technological standards.

e. Communication with users - A CSP is expected to be transparent to its users and provide them sufficient information to enable users to understand clearly their roles and responsibilities in managing risks related to their use of a CSP.

The contracting party’®, the DPS or the ODPS, shall be responsible for ensuring that the CSP meets the above-cited expectations and that operations of the CSP shall be held to the same standards as if the services were provided by the DPS or ODPS itself. The Bangko Sentral, however, is not precluded from directly engaging with and exercising its oversight function over the CSP in accordance with the PSOF.

102.6 Assessment by the Bangko Sentral. The Bangko Sentral shall adopt the PFMI assessment methodology (AM) to evaluate the observance of the relevant principles by a DPS as well as identify possible risks and induce changes in the NPS. In performing the PFMI assessment, the Bangko Sentral shall utilize the pertinent AM’s rating scale as laid out in Appendix 102-2.

102.7 Enforcement Action. Enforcement Action under Subsection 102.7 was transferred to Part 15 of the Manual.

### PART TWO ### RETAIL PAYMENT SYSTEM

### 201 NATIONAL RETAIL PAYMENT SYSTEM FRAMEWORK

201.1 Adoption of NRPS Framework. \t is the policy of the Bangko Sentral to promote the establishment of a safe, efficient, and reliable retail payment system in the Philippines. Towards this end, the Bangko Sentral adopts the National Retail Payment System (NRPS) Framework consistent with Bangko Sentral regulations on risk management in light of the complex interplay of different types of risk arising from the rapid evolution of retail payment activities of Bangko Sentral supervised financial institutions (BSFls). The NRPS vision will help achieve higher economic growth and enhance the overall competitiveness of our economy.

In carrying out retail payment-related activities, BSFIls shall adhere to the NRPS Framework as set forth in this Section and Appendix 201-1. This framework requires BSFls to ensure that the retail payment systems they participate in demonstrate sound risk management, and effective and efficient interoperability. BSFls shall comply with Bangko Sentral rules and regulations, particularly on information technology, consumer protection, and anti-money laundering/combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT).

201.2 Purpose and scope. The NRPS Framework shall apply to all BSFIs which meet regulatory requirements and the criteria set on a per Automated Clearing House (ACH) basis under the NRPS framework.

The NRPS framework covers all retail payment-related activities, mechanisms, institutions and users. It applies to all domestic payments which are denominated in Philippine Peso (Php), and which may be for payments of goods and services, domestic remittances or fund transfers.

Retail payments under the NRPS Framework are payments that meet at least one of ### the following characteristics:

the payment is not directly related to a financial market transaction;

the settlement is not time-critical;

the payer, the payee, or both are individuals or non-financial organizations; and either the payer, the payee, or both are not direct participants in the payment system that is processing the payment.

ano

201.3 NRPS key principles. Under the NRPS framework, sound governance shall be performed by a payment system management body (PSMB), an industry-led self- governing body that is duly recognized and overseen by the Bangko Sentral. In the absence of a PSMB which conforms to the NRPS principles in Appendix 201-1, the functions of providing sound governance to the retail payment system participated in by BSFls shall be discharged by the Bangko Sentral. Clearing switch operators shall not participate in the governance of the payment system.

All clearing shall be done within the NRPS governance structure, wherein exclusive bilateral clearing arrangements are not allowed.

Non-discriminatory participation shall be espoused in the retail payment system. Hence, all BSFls are highly encouraged to join the NRPS governance structure provided they meet the qualification criteria.

Page 15 of 71

## Page 26

A reasonable market-based and transparent pricing mechanism shall be adopted by all BSFls participating in the NRPS governance structure.

Further details on the key principles are embodied in the NRPS Framework shown in Appendix 201-1.

201.4 Specific rules applicable to transactions performed under the NRPS framework. The following rules shall apply to retail payment transactions which are ### cleared and settled in accordance with the NRPS Framework:

a. Minimum requirements to offer Electronic Payment and Financial Service (EPFS). EPFS, which shall require Bangko Sentral approval in accordance with Sec. X701/47010/4641S/4641P/4641N of the MORB/MORNBFI, refer to BSFI products and/or services that enable consumers to carry out or initiate payments electronically, financial transactions and other related services through a point of ### interaction. To offer EPFS, BSFls shall conform to the following requirements:

(1) BSFls shall make electronic payments available in all its delivery channels whenever applicable;

(2) BSFls shall enable its clients to move/receive funds to/from accounts with other BSFls, or, ata minimum, receive funds. Movement of funds between BSFIs shall be carried out through participation in an ACH;

(3) BSFls shall immediately credit the account of its clients after receipt of clearing advice; and

(4) BSFIs_ shall conform to Section X701/47010/4641S/4641P/4641N of the MORB/MORNBFI the IT Risk Management Standards and Guidelines on electronic banking, electronic payment, electronic money and other electronic products and services provided in Appendix 75f/Q-59fthe MORB/MORNBFI.

b. Fees on transactions. The BSFl’s board of directors shall adopt a policy on the imposition of any fee on electronic payment transactions. The policy shall include the basis and quantitative support for the setting of fees and rationalization of the fee structure or amount. Imposition of fees for transactions performed by BSFls that meet the requirements in Item “a” of this Subsection shall be consistent with ### the following:

(1) On consumer pricing -

(a) BSFls shall adopt reasonable and fair market-based pricing models, which do not arise from agreements with other BSFIls to fix the price of product or service delivery.

(b) The service fees for electronic payments are expected to be lower than the fees collected from transactions made manually or over-the-counter (OTC) as electronic payments are considered to provide more efficient and cost- effective means of delivering service.

(c) The recipient shall not pay for electronic crediting to recipient’s account and the recipient shall receive the amount in full. Such account-to- account fund transfers shall not be considered as domestic remittance transactions under Sections X906/49210Q/4660S/4660 of the MORB/MORNBFI.

Page 16 of 71

## Page 27

(2) The BSFI shall disclose to the Bangko Sentral the details of all fees that will be charged to the client. This will be posted in an electronic bulletin board of fees for transactions performed under the NRPS framework. The bulletin board shall be maintained by the Bangko Sentral in its website for enhanced transparency and competitiveness.

c. Anti-Money Laundering Requirements. All BSFls shall observe applicable AML/CFT requirements under Part Eight of the MORB/MORNBFI for all transactions performed under the NRPS framework. As part of on-going monitoring of customers and their transactions, the following rules shall apply to transactions performed under the NRPS framework by BSFls that meet the requirements in ### Item “a” of this Subsection:

(1) The originating institution (O/) shall be responsible for monitoring, including appropriate watchlist screening or monitoring, its own clien’'s transactions. It is the responsibility of the Ol to ensure that the account name of the source account and the amount are consistent with the Sender Name and the amount indicated in the Payment Instruction sent by the Ol.

(2) The receiving institution (RI) shall be responsible for monitoring, including appropriate watchlist screening or monitoring, its own client’s transactions. It is the responsibility of the RI to ensure that the actual account number credited and the amount are consistent with the Beneficiary Account Number and the amount indicated in the Payment Instruction received by the RI.

(3) On the basis of the above, account number matching will suffice for domestic account-to-account electronic payments. Ols and Rls shall ensure that customers are informed that account number matching will suffice to implement a transaction, and Ols and Rls shall be held free and harmless from liability for their reliance on account number matching.

(4) Nothing in the above rules shall prevent an Ol or RI from instituting or implementing additional procedures to comply with AML laws and regulations, and other applicable laws and regulations, prior to executing a transaction performed under the NRPS framework, or debiting/crediting a client’s account.

d. BSFls participating in the NRPS governance structure are required to comply with existing regulations of the Bangko Sentral.

201.5 Reports. BSFls participating in the NRPS governance structure shall comply with regular reporting requirements, which will be covered by a separate issuance.

201.6 Examination of BSFlIs. BSFls shall make available all policies, procedures and other documents/information related to this Section during the on-site examination, as well as provide copies thereof when a written request is made by the Bangko Sentral.

201.7 Sanctions. Consistent with Section XO09/4009Q, the Bangko Sentral may deploy enforcement actions to promote adherence to the requirements set forth in Section X1205/41205Q/4705S/4705P/4805N the MORB/MORNBFI and bring about timely corrective actions. The Bangko Sentral may issue directives to enforce compliance with the NRPS Framework or impose sanctions to limit the level of or

Page 17 of 71

suspend any business activity that has adverse effects on the safety and soundness of the BSFI, among others.

Any violation of this Section shall subject the BSFI and/or its directors, officers and/or employees to the monetary and non-monetary sanctions under Section 37 of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7653, including but not limited to the following depending on ### the gravity of the violation committed and the circumstances attendant thereto:

a. Suspension of offering new electronic financial products and services;

b. Suspension/revocation of authority to provide electronic financial products and services; and

c. Suspension/revocation of authority to settle through the Philippine Payments and Settlements System

### PART FOUR ### GOVERNANCE AND OVERSIGHT

### 401 GOVERNANCE POLICY FOR OPERATORS OF PAYMENT SYSTEM

401.1 Policy Statement. The Bangko Sentral recognizes that the OPS play an important role in sustaining the safe and efficient flow of payments including those arising from critical financial market transactions between and among banks and non-banking financial institutions, including cooperatives. Being generally responsible for interlinking these institutions that execute payment orders in their normal course of business, the OPS are also crucial in maintaining the public's confidence in the financial system.

In this regard, the Bangko Sentral adopts the following governance policy which is aligned with the applicable Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMIs) recommended by the Committee of Payments and Settlement Systems of the Bank for International Settlements and the Technical Committee of the International Organization of Securities Commissions. These guidelines provide specific regulatory expectations in the application of certain principles in consideration of national conditions.

401.2 Scope and Applicability. This policy covers all registered OPS including the Bangko Sentral, being the operator of the real time gross settlement (RTGS) system. Other OPS include the (i.) Bangko Sentral-supervised financial institutions (BSFls) which include banks and non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) such as non-bank electronic money issuers (EMI-NBFIls); and (ii.) non-BSFls such as cooperatives which are regulated by the Cooperative Development Authority (CDA), branches and subsidiaries of foreign incorporated entities as well as other domestic corporations and non-corporate entities, whose businesses are considered that of an OPS under existing Bangko Sentral regulations.

For BSFIs

An OPS that has concurrent licenses such as a banking license or a license to be an EMI-NBEFI shall adhere with the more stringent requirements between the guidelines in this policy and the applicable provisions of the Manual of Regulations for Banks (MORB) and the Manual of Regulations for Non-Bank Financial Institutions (MORNBFI) to be able to comply with the overall regulatory expectations of the Bangko Sentral.

The policy cross refers to certain governance standards under the MORB and the MORNEFI since these requirements are also applicable to all OPS regardless of their concurrent authorities.

For branches or local subsidiaries of foreign incorporated OPS

An OPS. whose Head Office or Parent Company is under the jurisdiction of a foreign regulator, shall follow the more stringent requirements between the provisions of this policy and those prescribed by the relevant regulator in its home jurisdictions.

In case the requirements of the home regulator prevail, the governance arrangements being observed by the Head Office or Parent Company that are in accordance with the requirements of the relevant regulator in its home jurisdiction may be used as a means to comply with the Bangko Sentral's policy. Proof of compliance with the requirements of the relevant regulator shall be made available upon request of the oversight department of the Bangko Sentral. Failure to submit proof of compliance

Page 20 of 71

## Page 31

with the requirements of the relevant regulator shall be deemed a violation of this provision and shall subject the OPS to appropriate enforcement actions under Bangko Sentral regulations.

In this context, a branch of a foreign incorporated OPS shall refer to any permanent office or place of business in the Philippines where an OPS may perform activities and provide products and services that are within the scope of its authority as an OPS. and of its other licenses, if any.

Specific Duties and Responsibilities of a director. The position of a director is a position of trust which assumes fiduciary responsibilities for different stakeholders of the payment system. Hence, the members of the board of directors should exercise their “duty of care” and “duty of loyalty” to the OPS.

a. Jo remain fit and proper for the position for the duration of his term. A director should possess unquestionable credibility to make decisions objectively and resist undue influence. He shall treat board directorship as a profession and shall have a clear understanding of his duties and responsibilities as well as his role in promoting good governance.

A director must always act in good faith, with the care which a prudent man would exercise under similar circumstances. While a director should always strive to promote the interest of all stockholders, he should also give due regard to the rights and interests of other stakeholders.

c. Jo have a working knowledge of the statutory and regulatory requirements affecting the institution. A director should be knowledgeable of the regulations of the Bangko Sentral, the provisions of the NPSA, and where applicable, the requirements of other relevant regulatory agencies. A director should also keep himself informed of financial system developments and payment system trends and relevant international standards in order to safeguard the interest of the OPS.

enumerated as items “b”, “d”, “e”’, “f’ “g” and “i” in Sections 132/132-Q of the MORB/MORNEFI (Specific duties and responsibilities of a director).

401.6 Board-Level Committees. The board of directors may delegate some of its functions, but not its responsibilities, to board-level committees. In this regard, the ### board shall:

Page 33 of 71

## Page 44

a. Approve, review, and update at least annually or whenever there are significant changes to the charter of each committee or other governance arrangements that set out a committee’s mandate, scope of function, and working arrangements. These arrangements shall articulate how the committee will report to the board of directors, what the committee members are expected to deliver, and how long a member may serve the committee. The board shall also consider occasional rotation of committee members and chairs to avoid undue concentration of power and promote fresh perspective.

b. Appoint members of the committees, considering the optimal mix of skills and experiences to allow the board of directors, through the committees, to fully understand and objectively evaluate relevant issues. To promote objectivity, the board shall appoint independent directors and non-executive members of the board. Towards this end, an independent director who is a member of any committee that exercises executive or management functions which can potentially impair such director's independence cannot accept membership in committees that perform independent oversight/control functions such as the Audit, Risk Oversight, or Corporate Governance Committee without prior approval of the Monetary Board.

In the case of a cooperative, the Audit Committee members that meet the qualifications stated in this policy shall be elected by the cooperative’s General Assembly pursuant to R.A. No. 9520.

c. Ensure that each committee maintains appropriate records (e.g., minutes of meetings or summary of matters reviewed and decisions taken) of their deliberations and decisions. Such records shall document the committee’s fulfillment of its responsibilities and facilitate the assessment of the performance of the committee’s functions.

d. Form an Audit Committee unless directed by the Bangko Sentral to create other board-level committees (i.e., Risk Oversight or Corporate Governance Committee) such as the case for Operators of Designated Payment Systems (ODPS) under Section 401.10. Provided, that the board of directors shall discuss risk management and corporate governance matters in its meetings, with the views of the independent director/s, in addition to those of the other directors, duly considered and minuted.

In complying with this provision, OPS that are branches or locally incorporated subsidiaries of foreign incorporated OPS may resort to the global or regional board- level committees formed by their Head Office or Parent Company. Hence, these OPS need not form their own local board and board-level committees to comply with this provision. However, depending on the nature, scale and complexity of their local businesses they may be required by the Bangko Sentral to form local management committees to oversee risk management, internal control, compliance and strategic concerns emanating from their local operations.

Audit Committee

### PART SEVEN ### SETTLEMENT

### 701 SETTLEMENT OF ELECTRONIC PAYMENTS UNDER THE NATIONAL RETAIL ### PAYMENT SYSTEM (NRPS) FRAMEWORK

701.1 Policy Statement. It is the thrust of the Bangko Sentral to ensure the efficiency of payment systems in the country. In line with this, the Bangko Sentral requires BSP-Supervised Financial Institutions (BSFls) participating in an Automated Clearing House (ACH) for electronic payments to ensure that this ACH provides certainty of settlement of the multilateral clearing obligations of the clearing participants. The settlement scheme agreed upon by the clearing participants shall form an integral part of the comprehensive risk management (i.e., including management of credit and settlement risks, among others) for electronic payment services.

701.2 Minimum requirements for the operation of a settlement mechanism for electronic payments. Settlement mechanisms for electronic payments shall meet ### the following minimum requirements:

a. Aclearing participant or its settlement sponsor shall maintain with the Bangko Sentral a demand deposit account (DDA) which shall be used specifically for the settlement of the clearing participant’s net clearing obligations arising from electronic payments;

### b. Distinct DDAs shall be separately established and used for each of the following: (i) instant retail payments, and (ii) batch clearing and settlement of electronic payments;

c. The clearing participant or its settlement sponsor shall prefund the settlement of its net clearing obligation through the DDA stated in Item “a”above, ensuring that such account can sufficiently cover said obligation at any point during a settlement cycle. In determining the adequate amount of prefunding, the clearing participant/settlement sponsor shall consider the number of settlement cycles within a clearing day, and the length of settlement cycles such as during weekends and holidays, among others;

d. The clearing participants shall agree on thresholds which shall be the bases of the CSO in determining if the balances of the DDAs are sufficient for clearing and settlement of the participants’ electronic payments in any given settlement cycle.

In the case of instant retail payments, the CSO shall execute a notification process that enables the clearing participants to efficiently monitor movements in their instant retail payment positions, and at the same time alerts them to place additional funds in their DDAs particularly when the agreed-upon threshold is breached.

As regards batch clearing and settlement of electronic payments, the CSO shall provide a system that enables clearing participants to monitor movements and place additional funds, when necessary, in their DDAs in a timely manner for each and every settlement cycle;

Page 54 of 71

## Page 65

e. The service contract between the clearing participants and the CSO shall ### include, at a minimum, the following provisions:

### (1) For instant retail payments:

(a) The CSO shall record the clearing participants’ DDA balances obtained from the Bangko Sentral at the start of every settlement cycle and Monitor the clearing participants’ net clearing obligations against their respective account balances;

(b) Should the instant retail payments position (funds in the DDA minus net clearing obligation/withdrawal from the DDA) of any of the clearing participants breach their agreed-upon thresholds, the CSO shall immediately send an electronic notification to the concerned clearing participant; and

(c) Any instant retail payment which is not fully covered by the corresponding DDA or which will result in a negative instant retail payments position shall be rejected by the CSO. A clearing participant with an instant retail payments position of zero shall be suspended from carrying out further outgoing instant payment transactions until said participant registers a positive position on account of its incoming payment transactions and/or subsequent deposits into its DDA.

### (2) For batch clearing and settlement of electronic payments:

(a) The CSO shall record the clearing participants’ DDA balances obtained from the Bangko Sentral prior to the initial settlement cycle of the day; (b) The CSO shall allow clearing participants to effectively monitor the sufficiency of their DDA balances for every settlement cycle by providing access to timely data on the clearing participants’ net clearing obligations

against their respective DDA balances;

(c) Should the balance ofa clearing participant’s DDA be insufficient to settle its net clearing results, the participant shall ensure prompt settlement by funding its DDA with the Bangko Sentral either prior to the specified settlement cut-off time or within the agreed-upon grace period after the settlement cut-off time. If the clearing participant fails to sufficiently fund its DDA for a specific settlement cycle, the CSO shall exclude all of the said clearing participant’s payment instructions from the net clearing results transmitted to the Bangko Sentral for such settlement cycle;

(d) If the CSO receives a settlement failure report from the Bangko Sentral, the CSO shall re-process the transactions and generate a revised net settlement report which excludes all payment instructions from the clearing participants with insufficient DDA balances; and

(e) Clearing participants that fail to sufficiently fund their net obligations in a timely manner shall be subject to commensurate penalties as provided under the ACH rules and regulations; and

f. Should the clearing participants determine that the funds in their DDAs for electronic payments are excessive after taking into account their highest potential clearing obligations and agreed-upon threshold, the clearing participants shall be allowed to withdraw from their DDAs to enable them to make optimal use of their funds, provided that such withdrawal will not result in a deficiency in the required reserve of the bank/QB.

The Bangko Sentral shall not be precluded from deploying applicable regulatory enforcement actions to concerned clearing participants notwithstanding the inclusion of sanctions in the ACH for non-compliance with the clearing participants’ agreed-upon settlement mechanism.

## Page 66

701.3 Risk management. In view of the risks involved in the prescribed settlement mechanism for electronic payments, including the possibility that a rejected payment transaction of a client due to prefunding issues may give rise to serious reputational damages to the concerned clearing participant, the BSFls participating in any ACH shall ensure that they have the necessary operational and liquidity risk management measures in place. Such measures shall be designed in accordance with the guidelines provided under Sections 146/146-Q/125-N on Operational Risk Management and 145/145-Q/144-S/1I24-N on Liquidity Risk Management of the ### MORB/MORNBFI.

701.4 Demand deposits for electronic payments as eligible reserves. Tne DDAs maintained with the Bangko Sentral for the settlement of net clearing obligations arising from electronic payment transactions shall form part of the banks’/QBs’ reserves against deposit and deposit substitute liabilities pursuant to Section 252/212-Q on the Composition of Reserves of the MORB/MORNBFI.

### BANGKO SENTRAL ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY ### AND RATING FRAMEWORK

The Bangko Sentral shall adopt the PFMI assessment methodology' (AM) to evaluate the observance of the relevant principles by a designated payment system (DPS) as well as identify possible risks and induce changes in the national payment system (NPS). In line with this. the Bangko Sentral shall also utilize the pertinent AM's rating scale and language in communicating the assessment against the relevant principles ### identified in Appendix 102-1:

I RatingScale?I I —s(Description Observed The DPS observes the principle. Any identified gaps and shortcomings are not issues of concern and are minor, manageable. and of a nature that the DPS could consider taking up in the normal course of its business. Broadly The DPS broadly observes the principle. One or Observed more issues of concern have been identified that the DPS is enjoined to address and follow up to better manage risks or improve operations. The DPS should pursue’ such improvements in a defined timeline.

Partly The DPS partly observes the principle. The

Observed assessment has identified one or more issues of concern that could become serious if not addressed in a timely manner. The DPS should accord a high priority to address these issues.

Not Observed I The DPS does not observe the principle. The assessment has identified one or more serious issues of concern that warrant immediate action. Therefore, the DPS must accord the highest priority to address these issues in a _ timely manner.

Not Applicable} The principle does not pertain to the type of DPS being assessed because of the particular legal, institutional, structural, or other characteristics of the DPS.

1 As set forth in the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures, Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and IOSCO, 2012.

2 The rating scale is built on the gravity and urgency to remedy identified "issues of concern." For the purpose of this scale, an "issue of concern" is a risk management flaw, a deficiency or lack of transparency or effectiveness that needs to be addressed.

Appendix 201-1 ### NATIONAL RETAIL PAYMENT SYSTEM (NRPS) FRAMEWORK A. NRPS Framework

The NRPS is a policy and regulatory framework that aims to establish a safe, efficient, and reliable electronic retail payment system in the Philippines. Given that retail payment systems contribute to the stability and efficiency of the financial system as a whole, the attainment of the NRPS vision will help achieve higher economic growth and enhance overall competitiveness of our economy.

With the rapid evolution of retail payments due to advancements in technology, retail payments related activities of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Supervised Financial Institutions (BSFIs) introduced a complex interplay of different types of risks. Thus, while the Bangko Sentral promotes the modernization of the country’s retail payment system in accordance with the NRPS Framework, it is critical to ensure that enabling policies and a multifaceted approach to strengthening risk management are timely adopted, and greater attention is devoted to retail payments activities of BSFls such as clearing and settlement.

In carrying out these activities, BSFIs are expected to adhere to the NRPS Framework and measures aimed at strengthening risk management as set forth in Section 201 of the MORPS and this Appendix. Hence, the retail payment system and activities that BSFls participate in should establish the ### following:

(1) Strengthened risk management through a better, holistic and multi- stakeholder approach to governance, and an enhanced transparency of clearing and settlement transactions classified according to risk profile.

(2) Augmented efficiencies and effectiveness in the retail payment system by minimizing duplicative efforts, promoting interoperability among retail payment system participants, standardizing clearing and settlement rules, and harmonizing various initiatives towards the achievement of the shared goals of safe, reliable and efficient retail payment system.

(3) Continued compliance with Bangko Sentral rules and regulations particularly on information technology, consumer protection, and anti- money laundering/combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT)

Retail payments under the NRPS Framework are payments that meet at least one of the following characteristics: (i) the payment is not directly related to a financial market transaction; (ii) the settlement is not time- critical; (iii) the payer, the payee, or both are individuals or non-financial organizations; and (iv) either the payer, the payee, or both are not direct participants in the payment system that is processing the payment. This definition of retail payment includes person-to-person, person-to-business, business-to-person, business-to-business, person/business-to-government,

Page 1 of 7

## Page 87

and government-to-person/business payments.’ On the other hand, large- value payments refer to payments, generally of very large amounts, which are mainly exchanged between banks or between participants of financial markets and that usually require urgent and timely settlement.

The Bangko Sentral, as a central bank, generally plays a variety of essential roles in the payment system by being an operator of the real-time gross settlement system (RTGS), an overseer in core payment arrangements, a user and participant of payment services, and, most critically, a catalyst for payment system reform. It is through the performance of these roles that the Bangko Sentral seeks to acquire a broader and holistic perspective on the role and the status of the payment system in the financial system and the economy in accordance with one of the pillars of central banking of promoting safe and efficient payment systems in the country.

(1) Key Principles

(a) Governance of the payment system shall be separate and distinct from the actual clearing operations to enable the retail payment system participants to effectively and efficiently deploy resources to focused and specialized activities. The governance of the payment system includes the establishment and implementation of standards and rules among payment system participants.

(b) Sound governance shall be performed by an industry-led self- governing body that is duly recognized and overseen by the Bangko Sentral.

(c) All qualified BSFls may apply to be direct clearing participants and, as such, participate in the governance structure.

(d) All clearing participants shall subscribe to and comply with the PSMB- formulated principles, policies, and business rules that will govern the payments system.

(e) All clearing shall be done within the NRPS governance structure. Bilateral clearing arrangements outside of the NRPS governance structure are considered as undertakings that carry risks that cannot be identified, measured, monitored and/or controlled, nor can said undertakings be properly considered in attaining a_ holistic perspective and improving governance of the retail payment system. Hence, bilateral arrangements outside of the NRPS governance structure shall not be allowed and failure to comply therewith shall result in deployment of appropriate supervisory actions from the Bangko Sentral.

(f) All significant retail payment streams shall be covered by an ACH.

(g)Non-discriminatory participation shall be espoused in the retail payment system by allowing all qualified direct clearing participants to participate in the formulation of standards and rules, as well as participate in business arrangements.

(h) A reasonable market-based and transparent pricing mechanism shall be adopted by all BSFls which are clearing participants. Reasonable service fees shall be allowed only for actual services rendered directly

' Developing a comprehensive National Retail Payments Strategy, Financial Infrastructure Systems Policy and Research, World Bank, October 2012

## Page 88

related to the delivery of Electronic Payment and Financial Services to clients of a BSFI.

(i) Bangko Sentral policies and supervisory actions, not directly involving payments governance within the scope of the PSMB, shall be addressed directly to the individual payment system participants as BSFIs.

### (2) Objectives:

(a) To enable effective and efficient interface and interoperability using shared and resilient infrastructure;

(b) To foster innovation and new business models;

(c) To promote fair access and competition amongst NRPS participants;

(d) To facilitate the provision of a wide range of payment products and services with needed certainty, affordability (based on a reasonable market-based pricing methodology) and trust; and

(e) To make relevant information on retail payment system available to concerned stakeholders.

The NRPS Framework espouses the cooperation of different competitors, or what is known as “coopetition’, in the domestic retail payments by delineating areas to be covered between the cooperative and the competitive spheres.

It is recognized that certain areas are dedicated for cooperation and collaboration among BSFls participating in the retail payment system towards the common goals of safety, efficiency, reliability and resiliency. This cooperative sphere centers on the clearing and settlement activities of BSFls which shall collaborate through the formulation and implementation of clearing and settlement standards, rules, and agreements under a formal governance structure that conforms to the NRPS principles.

To complement the cooperative sphere is the competitive sohere where the NRPS principles promote competition through innovation in the delivery of quality and cost-effective financial products and services, the creation of new business models customized to the needs of target consumers, and the development of services with a higher level of security, among others. The competitive sphere shall be governed by reasonable, transparent and effective consumer pricing mechanisms to allow BSFls cost-recovery and fair financial returns. Each BSFI shall be responsible for prescribing its pricing mechanisms for its financial products and services taking into consideration, among others, the nature of the product or service, the market segment to be served and the costs incurred to provide such product or service.

b. Governance - Payment System Management Body (PSMB)

The PSMB is an industry-led self-governing body that is duly recognized and overseen by the Bangko Sentral.

To attain a holistic perspective and multi-stakeholder organized structure that would bring about good governance in the retail payment system, BSFls shall adhere to the following key principles when engaging in clearing activities and must do so only within the NRPS governance structure.

Page 3 of 7

## Page 89

(g) The PSMB shall be independent from the clearing switch operator/s with respect to business operations.

Page 4 of 7

## Page 90

(h) All BSFls that are part of the NRPS governance structure shall subscribe to and comply with the PSMB-formulated principles, policies, and business rules that will govern the payments system provided such PSMB-formulated principles, policies and business rules are in conformity with the NRPS Framework and principles as well as applicable laws and regulations.

(2) Objectives (a) The PSMB will provide sound governance to the retail payment system and serve as a forum of collaboration for ensuring appropriate conditions for retail payments in the country. Towards this end, the
