Chapter!

### REPORTING GUIDELINES

Section 101. Reporting Standards

1. Reports submitted to the BSP as listed under Appendix 22 should be complete, accurate, consistent, reliable and timely to be considered compliant with the BSP reporting standards. Thus, reports with incomplete schedules or attachments shall be considered non-compliant with the reporting standards. Reports shall also conform to the relevant submission and validation guidelines as prescribed by the BSP. Reporting entities should review and validate reports prior to submission to the BSP and have adequate internal controls in place to ensure adherence to the reporting standards.

2. The submission of reports to the appropriate department of the BSP shall be effected by sending these through electronic means. The date when the report was electronically sent shall be considered as the date of filing.

3. Definitions

### a. Primary Report - A report where information is: (a) necessary for monitoring capital flows; and/or (b) principally part of a final report/output to be submitted to BSP Management for statistical and policy development purposes.

b. Secondary Report - A report not included in the definition of primary report.

c. Erroneous Report - A report submitted within the prescribed deadline but is found to be non-compliant with the

Page 4 of 13

## Page 5

BSP reporting standards described in Section 101 of the FX Manual. Submission of an Erroneous Report shall be considered as willful failure to comply with a regulation.

d. Delayed Report - A report compliant with the BSP reporting standards but submitted after the deadline. Submission of a compliant report after the submission deadline shall be considered as willful delay in submission of reports.

e. Unsubmitted Report - A report that was not submitted or was submitted but is not compliant with the BSP reporting standards by the time the next report becomes due or upon the lapse of 30 calendar days from the report's submission deadline, whichever comes first. Non-submission of reports under this item shall be considered as willful refusal to comply with a regulation.

' 4 In the implementation of the rules in this Section, the submission deadline is considered moved to the next banking day should it fall on a non-working day in the locality where the reporting entity is situated or on a working day where business operations in government offices were suspended due to typhoon, flood, or other fortuitous events.

Failure to submit a report on time due to fortuitous events, including, but not limited to, fire and other natural calamities, public disorders including strike and lockout affecting the reporting entity, as defined in the Labor Code of the Philippines or of a national emergency affecting the operation of reporting entities shall not be considered as willful failure to comply with a regulation, willful delay in submission or willful refusal to comply with a regulation.

5. To ensure the quality of reports, Section 102 prescribes the corresponding penalties for entities that fail to comply with the reporting standards prescribed in this Section.

6. The BSP may conduct, as described in Section 104, an assessment of the quality of the reporting system of the reporting entity in order to determine the underlying integrity of reports being submitted and root cause of persistent submission problems, if any.

Chapter II ### PENALTIES AND SANCTIONS Section 102. Penalties on Violation of Reporting Standards. To ensure the quality of the reports, the following procedures for the

imposition of monetary penalties for failure to comply with the reporting standards set under Section 101 shall apply in accordance

Page 5 of 3

## Page 6

with Section 37 of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7653 (The New Central Bank ### Act), as amended:

1. The applicable monetary penalty shall be based on a prescribed fine for each occurrence (in case of Erroneous reports) and/or for each calendar day (in case of Delayed or Unsubritted reports) which will accumulate until such time the report has been determined compliant with the prescribed reporting standards.

a. The following are the prescribed penalties for ### reporting violations of each entity type:

. Primary Secondary

Universal/Commarcialfisiarnic Banks PHP3,000 IAABForexCorps ss —~—“‘S;SC(*NC#COC#*#‘#ASOOIOC~*C‘«*@sS@ IThriftBanks(TBs) ss SS™~=*~dYS=C“‘éSSON“YLCB8QOOY

Offshore Banking Units (OBUs) 1,250 I Rural Banks(RBsVCoop Banks IS SO I «CdSO

Representative Offices (ROs) I == 300 {~ —s—=«S100

b. The monetary penalties for reporting violations shall ### be computed as follows:

Erroneous

Fora report initially considered Erroneous but subsequently complied with the reporting standards within the prescribed deadline, the penalty shall be computed by multiplying the prescribed fine by the number of times the subject report was submitted before being considered compliant.

Delayed

For Delayed reports, the penalty shall be computed by multiplying the prescribed fine by the number of calendar days delayed.

Erroneous and Delayed

if the report initially considered Erroneous was able to comply with the reporting standards after the prescribed deadiine (i.e, De/ayea)}, the penalty shall be based on the sum of the penalty for being Erroneous and the penalty for being Delayed.

Unsubmitted For reports classified as Unsubmitted (regardless if said

report was not submitted or was previously submitted but remains non-compliant as described in Section 101), the

Page 6 of 13

## Page 7

monetary penalty shall be three (3) times the number of ### days applied for determining such classification, as follows:

(Column B) Defined number of (Column A) calendar days after Reporting submission deadline to Frequency be considered “Unsubmitted'

(Column C) Number of calendar days for penalty computation

of reports considered “Unsubmitted'

Event-Based*

" Refers to reports that are not due under a regular periodicity since their required submission is instead reckoned from the occurrence of an event/incident or upon knowledge thereof.

In the event that a compliant report is submitted after it has been considered Unsubmitted, the applicable penalty shall be based on the number of calendar days provided in “Column C" of the preceding table. This will be the case even if the actual number of calendar days delayed is less than the constant number of days provided in said “Column C".

In cases of reports failing due within a period affected by a fortuitous event or within a relief period prescribed by the BSP, said reports should comply with the reporting standards of the BSP within 15 calendar days after the end of the said fortuitous event or regulatory relief. Otherwise, these shall be considered Unsubmitted and imposed with a monetary penalty equivalent to the applicable fine prescribed in Section 102.1.a multiplied by 45 calendar days [i.e., three (3) times 15 calendar days].

A reporting entity is still required to submit a compliant report regardless if said report has been classified as "Unsubmitied' unless the non-submission is approved by the BSP. Otherwise, failure to submit a compliant report within seven (7) calendar days from the time an instruction was made to submit the said Unsubrmitted report shall result in disciplinary enforcement action against the reporting entity in accordance with existing regulations such as, but not limited to, the BSP’s Supervisory Enforcement Policy under Section 002 of the MORB, as may be amended.

I For instance, a weekly report submitted on the eight (8th) calendar day after the

submission deadline will still be penalized the equivalent of twenty-one (21) days, while it likewise follows that a weekly report submitted on the twenty-eighth {28th) calendar day shall still be penalized for twenty-one (21) days.

2. The guidelines on the imposition of monetary penalties for violations in which sanctions fall under Section 37 of R.A. No. 7653, as amended, and other applicable laws are outlined in Appendix 24.

Section 103. Sanctions on Violation of Policy. To ensure compliance with laws, rules, regulations, orders or instructions, the BSP recognizes that there is a need to impose monetary or hon-monetary penalties as one of the possible administrative sanctions to hold AABs, AAB forex corps, OBUs, ROs, and/or their DTOEs accountable for their conduct, deter future commission of violations, achieve the overarching supervisory objectives of changed behavior and mitigated risk, and promote and maintain price stability,

external sustainability and the integrity and value of the Philippine peso,

For this purpose, the provisions on Supervisory Enforcement Policy embodied in Section 002 of the MORB, as may be amended, are hereby adopted. The BSP may impose monetary penalties singly or in combination with non-monetary penalties, if appropriate. Moreover, ### the following provisions are also adopted:

I. Definitions

a. Transactional violation - An act or omission constituting a violation of any applicable law, or any order, instruction/directive or regulation issued by the Monetary Board (MB), or any order, instruction/directive or ruling by the Governor which is consummated and concluded in a single instance/occasion.

b. Continuing violation - An act or omission constituting a violation of any applicable law or any _ order, instruction/directive or regulation issued by the MB, or any order, instruction/directive or ruling by the Governor in which the violation persists or lingers over time from the instant the particular act was committed or omitted until the violation is stopped.

2, Pursuant to Section 37 of R.A. No. 7653, as amended, AABs, AAB forex corps, OBUs, ROs, and/or their DTOEs may be imposed a maximum monetary penalty of PHP1,000,000 for each transactional violation or PHP100,000 per calendar day for violations of a continuing nature.

To ensure fairness, consistency and reasonableness in the imposition of monetary or non-monetary penalties, the BSP takes into consideration the attendant circumstances of each case, such as the nature and gravity of the violation or irregularity, the size of the financial institution, and other aggravating and mitigating factors.

## Page 9

3. The guidelines on the imposition of monetary penalties for violations in which sanctions fall under Section 37 of R.A. No. 7653, as amended, and other applicable laws are outlined in Appendix 24.

Section 104. Assessment of Reporting System. An assessment of reporting system may be done by the appropriate BSP department/office to ensure the integrity of the reports including improvements to the reporting system. If the results of the assessment disclose significant deficiencies in the reporting system, the reporting entity shail be required to submit a Board-approved action plan. Such action plan shall include measures that the reporting entity must undertake within a specified period of time to address the deficiencies noted.

Failure of the Board and Senior Management of the reporting entity to implement the required corrective measures within the specified timeframe shall be grounds to subject the reporting entity, including its Board, Senior Management and other responsible officer/s, to the BSP's Supervisory Enforcement Policy under Section 002 of the MORB, as may be amended. The imposition of penalties under this Section is without prejudice to imposition of other administrative or penal sanctions for violations of other rules and regulations being enforced by the BSP.

Guidelines on the Imposition of Monetary Penalties on Bangko Sentral ng

Pilipinas (BSP)-Supervised Financial Institutions (BSFIs) and/or their

Directors/Trustees, Officers and/or Employees (DTOEs) for Violations of Policies under the Manual of Regulations on Foreign Exchange Transactions, as amended, and Other Applicable Laws with Sanctions Falling under Section 37 of

Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7653 (The New Central Bank Act), as amended

(Appendix to Part Six, Chapter I! on Penalties and Sanctions)

The following are the guidelines on the imposition of monetary penalties on BSFls ### and/or their DTOEs:

I. Definition of Terms

a.

Transactional violation refers to an act or omission constituting a violation of any applicable law or any order, instruction/directive or regulation issued by the Monetary Board (MB), or any order, instruction/directive or ruling by the Governor which is consummated and concluded in a single instance/occasion.

Continuing violation refers to an act or omission constituting a violation of any applicable law or any order, instruction/directive or regulation issued by the MB, or any order, instruction/directive or ruling by the Governor in which the violation persists or lingers over time from the instant the particular act was committed or omitted until the violation is stopped.

Il. Imposition of Monetary Penalties

a.

b.

In accordance with Section 37 of R.A. No. 7653, as amended, monetary penalties may be imposed against BSFls and/or their DTOEs for any willful violation of its charter or bylaws; willful delay in the submission of reports or publications thereof as required by law, rules and regulations; any refusal to permit examination into the affairs of the institution; any willful making of a false or misleading statement to the MB or the appropriate supervising and examining department or its examiners; any willful failure or refusal to comply with, or violation of, any banking law or any order, instruction or regulation issued by the MB, or any order, instruction or ruling by the Governor; or any commission of irregularities, and/or conducting business in an unsafe or unsound manner as may be determined by the MB.

In the absence of specific provision under other applicable laws or BSP rules and regulations prescribing the imposable monetary penalty for the abovementioned violations/offenses, BSFls and/or their DTOEs may be imposed a maximum monetary penalty of PHP1,000,000 for each transactional violation or PHP100,000 per calendar day for violations of a continuing nature as provided under Section 37 of R.A. No. 7653, as amended. Further, in case profit is gained or loss is avoided as a result of the violation, the BSP may impose a fine of no more than three (3) times the profit gained or loss avoided on top of the monetary penalty.

## Page 37

### APPENDIX 24 Page 2 of 4

c. The BSP considers the attendant circumstances of the case, including aggravating and mitigating factors, in the guided exercise of discretion to reach a reasonable and proportionate monetary penalty that best achieve the BSP’s objectives. These factors include the: (i) nature, gravity and seriousness of the violation or irregularity; (ii) financial and/or non-financial impact of the violation or irregularity to the BSFI, its industry and/or the financial system; (iii) intentionality, frequency and duration of the violation or irregularity; and (iv) measures undertaken to stop or correct the violation or irregularity.

d. The appropriate department of the BSP shall notify the concerned BSFI and/or DTOE of the violation, together with a directive for the concerned BSFI and/or DTOE to show cause within 15 banking days from receipt of the letter why no monetary penalty under Section 37 of R.A. No. 7653, as amended, should be imposed. The recommendation to impose monetary penalties shall be approved by the Governor or the MB, as the case may be, pursuant to Section 37 of R.A. No. 7653, as amended; Provided, that monetary penalties against DTOEs shall be approved only by the MB. The decision of the Governor/MB shall be communicated to the concerned BSFI and/or DTOE.

e. The BSP is not precluded from imposing non-monetary penalties along with monetary penalties if circumstances so warrant.

Ill. Payment of Monetary Penalties

a. BSFls shall pay the monetary penalties within 15 calendar days from receipt of the notice of the decision of the Governor imposing said monetary penalties, and payment thereof shall not be suspended by the filing of an appeal to the MB.

b. Monetary penalties imposed by original decisions of the MB shall be paid within 15 calendar days from the last day to file a motion for reconsideration where none has been filed or within 15 calendar days from receipt of the notice of the decision of the MB affirming the decision on motion for reconsideration, as the case may be.

c. For uniform implementation of the above regulation, the following ### procedural guidelines shall be observed:

(1) Upon approval of the fines/penalties by the Governor/MB, the concerned BSP department/office shall send the Statement of Account (SOA)/billing letter to the BSFI with an advice that the penalty should be paid in full within 15 calendar days from receipt of SOA/billing letter. The amount of the penalty/ies that remain unpaid shall be automatically debited from the BSFI’s demand deposit account (DDA) with the BSP after the lapse of the 15-calendar day period within which to pay the monetary penalties. The BSFI shall likewise be advised that

### APPENDIX 24 Page 3 of 4

penalty or portion thereof which remained unpaid after the lapse of said 15-calendar day period shall be subject to additional charge of six percent (6%) per annum reckoned from the banking day immediately following the end of the 15-calendar day period up to the day of actual payment.

On the banking day immediately following the end of said 15-calendar day period, unpaid penalties shall be automatically debited, without additional charge, against the BSFI’s DDA with the BSP by the Comptrollership Sub-Sector (CoSS) based on the amount booked by the concerned BSP department/office after first confirming with the CoSS the sufficiency of the BSFI’s DDA balance to cover the amount of the penalty.

If, based on its confirmation with the CoSS, the concerned BSP department/office received information that the BSFI’s DDA balance is insufficient to cover the amount of the penalty, it shall accordingly advise and request the BSFI to immediately fund its DDA.

As soon as it is funded, the BSFI’s DDA shall be debited by the CoSS for the amount of the penalty, plus the six percent (6%) additional charge for late payment of the penalty reckoned from the banking day immediately following the end of the 15-calendar day period up to the day of actual payment, based on the amount booked by the concerned BSP department/office.

Payment by BSFls of penalty, plus the additional charge, if any, through any such acceptable means of payment shall be made in accordance with the pertinent advisories issued by the BSP.

In the case of penalty/ies imposed on DTOEs, the employer BSFI and said DTOE shall be advised by the appropriate department of the BSP that the employer BSFI’s DDA with the BSP shall be debited for the amount of the penalty as advance payment on behalf of the DTOE whose penalty/ies remain unpaid after the lapse of 15 calendar days within which to pay the monetary penalty. In case of BSFls that do not maintain DDA with the BSP and DTOEs that are connected with the BSFI without DDA or no longer connected with the BSFI, they shall be required to pay directly to the BSP within the 15-calendar day period through any acceptable means of payment as may be provided in the pertinent advisories issued by the BSP. The procedures under Items “2”, “3” and “4” hereof shall likewise apply.
