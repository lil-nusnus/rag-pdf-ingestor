### MEMORANDUM NO. M-2020- 083

To : ALL UNIVERSAL AND COMMERCIAL BANKS AND THEIR ### SUBSIDIARY BANKS

Subject : Transition from the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and Reporting Requirements on LIBOR-Related Exposures

In July 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority announced a transition away from LIBOR as a benchmark rate, with an agreement between the regulator and panel banks to voluntarily sustain LIBOR only until 31 December 2021. Since then, market participants have been strongly encouraged to take steps to transition to the use of alternative reference rates.

The Bangko Sentral expects every BSP-supervised financial institution (BSFI) with LIBOR or LIBOR-related exposures! to have a viable transition plan in place to ensure that the cessation of LIBOR does not disrupt its operations and the efficient provision of services to its clients and other market counterparties. This transition plan should be anchored on a clear understanding on the part of the BSFI of its exposures and risks. The plan shall likewise include strategies for actively reducing reliance on LIBOR sufficiently in advance of the discontinuation of the benchmark.

In line with the BSP’s monitoring of the progress of BSFls in transitioning away from LIBOR, all universal and commercial banks and their subsidiary banks are hereby required to submit quarterly reports on the extent of their remaining LIBOR-related exposures, beginning with the reference date of 30 September 2020 and ending with the reference date of 31 March 2022. The guidelines on the submission of the report can be found in Annex A.

BSFls are reminded that the periodic quantification of LIBOR-related exposures is only one aspect of the transition process. Overall operational readiness is essential to the smooth adoption of alternative reference rates. BSFls are expected to ensure that the necessary systems and infrastructure, as well as the appropriate contractual arrangements, are in place prior to the cessation of LIBOR.

BSFls are enjoined to keep abreast of transition initiatives taking place domestically and internationally, and to actively communicate with counterparties,

1 These include contracts referencing the Philippine Interbank Reference Rate.
