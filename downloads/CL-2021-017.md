### THE ACCREDITATION DOES NOT SERVE AS AN ENDORSEMENT OF THE BSP OF THE SOUNDNESS OF THE ABOVE LISTED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. The accreditation cannot be used for any purpose other than for implementing the provisions of the Agri-Agra Reform Credit Act of 2009 and its related rules and regulations.

Under existing rules and regulations, a lending and/or investing bank intending to utilize its exposure to an accredited RFI to comply with the agri-agra report must disclose such exposure in its agri-agra report submitted to the BSP along with the RFlâ€™s corresponding ARN. Exposure to the accredited RFI shall be eligible for determining compliance with the agri-agra requirement for as long as the said RFI remains validly accredited until sooner revoked for non-renewal or non-compliance with the qualification requirements prescribed under existing rules and regulations. In the event of disaccreditation, the lending/investing bank is allowed to use its exposure to a disaccredited RFI for compliance with the agri-agra requirement for a grace period of only up to the next reporting quarter following the disaccreditation. The Agri-Agra Report of the lending/investing bank shall be deemed defective if a disaccredited RFI is declared and used for compliance with the agri-agra requirement beyond the grace period. Hence, the above list of accredited RFls and their corresponding ARNs are being issued for reference and guidance of lending and/or investing banks.

The above updated list of RFls accredited by the BSP and ACPC supersedes those listed under Circular Letter No. CL-2020-011 dated 26 February 2020.
