3)

4)

The live implementation of COCREE 2.0 for Universal/Commercial Banks (U/KBs), their subsidiary Thrift Banks (TBs)/Non-bank Financial Institutions with Quasi- banking Functions (NBQBs)/Trust Corporations (TCs), and Digital Banks (DGBs) is rescheduled to commence with reporting period ending 30 September 2024 as ### presented in the table below:

Type of BSP- Live Implementation of COCREE 2.0 ### Supervised Financial Re : : â€” porting Reporting LUST Period Frequency Due Date U/KBs, subsidiary Ending 25 banking days after TBs/NBQBs/ TCs of Monthly reference reporting U/KBs, and DGBs 30 September 2024 period

As the pilot testing is extended until live implementation, U/KBs, their subsidiary TBs/ NBQBs/TCs, and DGBs are strongly urged to capitalize on the opportunity to be familiarized with the reporting protocols and rules of the COCREE 2.0.

Only records of reporting periods prior to the scheduled live implementation but after period ended 30 September 2023 can be used for pilot testing purposes. Records submitted during the pilot phase are primarily for testing purposes and cannot be considered as live submission. The submission of a subset of the entire COCREE 2.0 is permissible during the pilot phase with the understanding that it represents a substantial portion of the data points and fields for testing in order to optimize the benefits of the pilot exercise.

Submission of the 2021 COCREE (or COCREE 1.0) shall no longer be required upon live implementation of COCREE 2.0.
