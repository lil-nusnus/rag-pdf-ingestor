To : ALL BANKS

Subject : Regulatory Relief Measures for Banks Affected by Tropical Storm “Kristine”, and Super Typhoons “Leon”, “Ofel” and “Pepito”

The Monetary Board, in its Resolution No. 39 dated 9 January 2025 approved the grant of additional regulatory relief measures to banks with head offices and/or branches/branch-lite units or with end-user borrowers located in areas which were devastated by Tropical Storm “Kristine” and Super Typhoons “Leon”, “Ofel” and “Pepito” (collectively referred to as “the typhoons”). These relief measures are aimed at enabling banks to carry on with their business operations after extreme weather events and extend equivalent financial relief to their affected borrowers.

Affected banks are eligible to avail of the regulatory relief package specified in Section 1151 of the Manual of Regulations for Banks (MORB), subject to the ### following enhanced provisions:

1. The reckoning period of the regulatory relief measures shall be on the respective dates of the landfall of the typhoons in affected areas;

2. For financial assistance provided to officers who are affected by the typhoons that are not within the scope of the existing Bangko Sentral- approved purposes under Section 135 of the MORB (Loans, advances, and other credit accommodations to officers) the request for post-approval of the grant of loans, advances, or any other forms of credit accommodations to officers shall be submitted on or before 31 March 2025 to the appropriate supervising department of the Bangko Sentral for regularization; and

3. No penalties shall be imposed on legal reserve deficiencies, if any, by thrift banks, rural banks and cooperative banks computed under Section 255 of the MORB on Reserve Deficiencies; Sanctions, starting from reserve week 18 October 2024 up to six (6) months thereafter.

Taking a critical balance of their fiduciary duty and financial intermediation role, eligible banks are not precluded from granting a temporary grace period of up to six (6) months to their clients who were affected by the typhoons. The temporary grace period may cover all outstanding loans’ with payment of principal and/or interest falling due that may start on the respective dates of landfall of the typhoons. The implementation of the availed temporary grace period shall be based on the terms as agreed by banks and borrowers concerned. The parties, however, are not precluded from mutually agreeing to a grace period shorter than six (6) months. Banks are expected to discuss with their borrowers the other available options aside from the temporary grace period empowering the latter to make informed decisions considering their financial capabilities.

The loans subject of the temporary grace period shall be excluded from the computation of past due and non-performing loans ratios of banks. Said loans, however, shall still be subject to prudential reporting for supervisory purposes using

x i _ Refers to loans released on or before the respective dates of landfall of the typhoons.
