CIRCULAR LETTER NO. CL-2021-o52

### OFFICE OF THE DEPUTY GOVERNOR ### FINANCIAL SUPERVISION SECTOR

To : All BSP-Supervised Financial Institutions (BSFIs)

Subject : Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLC) Advisory on the Implementation of Freeze Orders (FOs)

This is to disseminate to all BSFls the Advisory' of the AMLC on the implementation of FOs. Said advisory articulates the AMLCâ€™s observation that some covered persons (CPs) submit returns on the implementation of FOs, concerning related accounts, only a few days before the expiration of the six (6)-month FO issued by the Court of Appeals against the main accounts. In addition, some CPs commence to implement the FOs a few days or weeks before the expiry of the period prescribed by the Court under the FO. Such late filing of Returns may be considered a violation of Rule 10, Section 4 (4.4), in relation to Section 4.2 (b), of the 2018 Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of the Anti-Money Laundering Act (AMLA), as amended, which prescribes the periods for filing of Returns on FOs.

### In view of the foregoing, all BSFls are advised that:

1. The periods for filing Returns on FOs should be strictly observed;

2. The twenty (20)-day effectivity of FOs should be reckoned from the time the accounts are actually frozen, as indicated in the Return, which shall be submitted within twenty-four (24) hours from freezing of the related accounts;

3. The late implementation of an FO and the consequent late submission of returns, or failure to file returns within a ### reasonable period may constitute:
