Authority to outsource. For material outsourcing arrangement, only banks with a SAFr composite rating’ of at least “3” shall be allowed to outsource designated activities without prior Bangko Sentral approval, subject to notification requirements provided in Appendix 149 - Section B. Banks with SAFr rating of below “3” must secure approval from the appropriate supervising department? of the Bangko Sentral prior to the implementation of material outsourcing arrangements (see Appendix 149 - ### Section C for the list of requirements), which covers any of the following:

a. New material outsourcing arrangements;

b. Changes in existing material outsourcing arrangements that have significant impact in the delivery of outsourcing services, business operations, reputation and profitability; and

c. Changes in existing outsourcing arrangements resulting in the reclassification of the arrangements as material such as, but not limited to those affecting the nature, scope, and complexity of systems and processes.

Governance and managing of outsourcing risks. xxx

a. Conduct materiality assessment (see Annex “A”) of the outsourcing ### activity, which shall consider the following factors:

(1) Level of importance xxx

### XXX (5) Exposure to risk of confidentiality xxx

Periodic assessments shall be conducted to ensure that outsourcing risks, both on a contract-specific level and on an institution-wide level, are managed vis-a-vis the impact to the overall operations.

In cases when the risk management system xxx b. Establish policies and criteria xxx

### XXX

‘In lieu of the SAFr composite rating, the CAMELS composite rating of at least “3” shall be used. If neither a SAFr nor CAMELS rating is available, other BSP rating may be used as basis provided that the overall assessment of the BSFI satisfies the descriptive criteria of SAFr composite rating “3”, as follows: BSFI is stable. Risks are adequately managed across the organization. Supervisory concerns are within the ability of the board and management to address. The BSFI's buffers will enable it to withstand most adverse events.

? Technology outsourcing applications/notifications shall be submitted to the Technology Risk and Innovation Supervision Department (TRISD). Meanwhile, non-technology outsourcing applications/notifications shall be submitted to the respective Financial Supervision Department ### (FSD).

f. Ensure the portability of the outsourced service (eg., degree of difficulty, cost, and time in switching to an alternative service provider or to bring the activity in-house) and the impact to business continuity and recovery and resolution plans of the financial institution.

### XXK

Other types of outsourcing arrangements. The guidelines and requirements of outsourcing to third-party service providers shall be observed when a bank (i) acts as the service provider, (ii) participates in intra- group outsourcing, or (iii) engages in offshore outsourcing.

a. Bank as a service provider. The bank may enter into an outsourcing agreement outside its business group, provided that the bank delivering the outsourced service shall adhere to the guidelines on outsourcing, as well as relevant laws and pertinent Bangko Sentral rules and regulations. It may also render services to its own depositors on account of the bank acting as the depository institution.

The service provider and service recipient should establish a clear understanding on rights and responsibilities on management of risks attendant to the outsourced activity, compliance with relevant laws, rules and regulations, and establishment of complaints handling and resolution process.

b. Intra-group outsourcing. Banks may enter into an intra-group outsourcing agreement without prior Bangko Sentral approval, in case: (i) the services rendered are performed in the ordinary course of business; (ii) the service provider is likewise a regulated financial institution; and (iii) the service is rendered to subsidiaries, affiliates and companies related to the service provider through common ownership.

The intra-group service provider may enter into a subcontracting agreement provided that said arrangement is regulated and authorized, as applicable, by the intra-group service provider's relevant regulatory authority.

The bank should ensure that the service provider has a sound financial condition and has the necessary competency to provide such service.

c. Offshore outsourcing. Offshore outsourcing of bank’s domestic operations is permitted only when: {i) the service agreement defines counterparties’ right and responsibilities on confidentiality and data privacy; and (ii) the service provider operates in jurisdictions with existing confidentiality and/or data privacy laws that are not in conflict with existing Philippine laws and relevant regulations.

Page 3 of 6

## Page 4

When the service provider is located in other countries, the bank should take into account and closely monitor, on continuing basis, government policies and other conditions in countries where the service provider is based during the risk assessment process. The bank shall also develop appropriate contingency and exit strategies. Meanwhile, a domestic subsidiary of a foreign bank may enter into a material offshore intra-group outsourcing agreement without prior Bangko Sentral approval, provided that the outsourcing service is either engaged or provided by. its parent bank, central service operations center, or designated entity within the group, which are duly regulated in their respective home jurisdictions.

The bank shall have the primary responsibility to ascertain the adequacy of design and effectiveness of service provider's security control mechanisms through audit procedures conducted by third party auditors or bank’s internal audit function. In the event that results from alternative audit mechanism and third-party validation do not satisfy the objectives and requirements of the outsourcing regulations, the Bangko Sentral shall obtain from the bank relevant information in relation to the outsourced operations. If reasonable means to conduct offsite procedures have been exhausted, the Bangko Sentral shall be given access to the service provider and those relating to the outsourced domestic operations of the bank. Such access may be fulfilled through coordination with host authorities, if necessary. The domestic subsidiary of a foreign bank shall be principally liable in cases where the clients are prejudiced due to errors, omissions and frauds of the service provider — located offshore.

The Bangko Sentral may require the bank to terminate xxx.

Section 2. The amendments to Appendices 103 and Q-36 of the MORB and MORNBEFI, respectively, are attached as Annex “B” of this Circular.

Section 3. Appendix 78 of the MORB (IT Risk Management Standards and Guidelines, Area: IT Outsourcing/Vendor Management) on emerging ### outsourcing models shall be amended as follows:

### XXX

3.2 Service Provider Selection. Before selecting a service provider, the BSFI should perform appropriate due diligence of the provider's financial soundness, reputation, managerial skills, technical capabilities, operational capability and capacity in relation to the services to be outsourced. The depth and formality of the due diligence performed may vary depending on the nature of the outsourcing arrangement and the BSFI’s familiarity with the prospective service providers. For arrangements involving data transfer and handling, BSFls should identify potential risks arising from physical and logical access of Technology Service Provider (TSP) employees, subcontractors, and other parties. As such, background checks on these

Page 4 of 6

## Page 5

logical access of Technology Service Provider (TSP) employees, subcontractors, and other parties. As such, background checks on these companies are important to ensure that data are not being hosted by an organization that has a history or track record of not upholding confidentiality of information or that is engaging in malicious or fraudulent activity. Business resilience and technical capability of the TSP in providing security and controls, audit and compliance, monitoring, and reporting requirements of the BSFI should also be carefully considered. Contract negotiation should xxx

### XXX ### XXX

3.6 Security and Privacy. With growing concerns on data privacy and data security, BSFis shall ensure that all confidential and sensitive data and information exposed to the TSP environment are well-managed and protected. BSFls shall ensure that all data being handled, processed, and/or stored thru an outsourcing arrangement are included in its data inventory and data classification process. BSFls shall likewise ensure that TSPs follow appropriate data handling procedures and employ robust access control mechanisms.

Moreover, BSFIs shall see to it that the TSP conducts periodic monitoring and reporting of security-related threats, incidents, and events on its networks/systems. The TSP should also have proactive incident response and problem management process in place, equipped with digital forensic tools and capabilities.

In order to assess the TSP’s ability to enforce appropriate technical, physical, and administrative safeguards (i.e, access controls, data segregation, etc.) across its organization, BSFis may refer to independent assessments (e.g., external audit, security certificates, among others) which provide attestation on the effectiveness of the TSP’s control environment and security mechanisms.

3.7 Data Ownership and Data Location and Retrieval. One of the most common areas of concern in technology outsourcing is data transit, storage, and retrieval particularly in view of the multi-region cloud deployment setup. Such arrangement heightens challenges in assessing the design and control effectiveness of systems and processes across multiple physical locations. Moreover, laws, rules, regulations, and other compliance requirements may widely vary across jurisdictions where data is being transmitted, processed, and/or stored.

To address this, BSFis must obtain a sound understanding of the TSP’s physical and logical controls over its information assets. BSFIs should be able to identify where the data is being processed and/or stored and assess

Page 5 of 6

## Page 6

whether the corresponding jurisdictions uphold data sovereignty laws. In any case, BSFis should ensure that ownership rights over its data must be clearly defined in the contract to establish the proper level of data access and control. At a minimum, the contract should contain the following provisions: i) the BSFI retains exclusive ownership over all of its data; ii) the TSP acquires no rights whatsoever to use the BSFI’s data for its own purpose ### or for any purpose other than what is required based on the scope of service: and iii) the TSP does not have the right to prevent the duly authorized access of BSFi to its own data. For these provisions to work as intended, the terms of data ownership must not be subject to unilateral amendment by the TSP.

3.8 Business Continuity Planning Consideration. The BSF! should integrate the TSP’s BCP into its own plan, communicate functions to the appropriate personnel, and maintain and periodically review the combined plan. It should ensure that the TSP tests its plan annually and notify the institution of any resulting modifications. BSFis shall likewise establish contingency plans in case the TSP becomes unavailable or inaccessible. Appropriate contingency and resumption strategies should be formulated to consider both short-term and prolonged unavailability/inaccessibility of the TSP.

3.9 Compliance with Bangko Sentral Regulations. xxx

Section 4. Section 4 of Appendix 78 of the MORB (IT Risk Management Standards and Guidelines, Area: IT Outsourcing/Vendor Management) on emerging outsourcing models and Annex A of Appendix 78 of the MORB shall be deleted.

Section 5. Section 112-T of the MORNBFI is hereby amended to read, as ### follows:

“Section 112-T Guidelines on Outsourcing. The rules on outsourcing of services as shown under Sec. 112 of the MORB and Appendix Q-36, in so far as applicable, shall apply to TCs.

Section 6. Effectivity. This Circular shall take effect fifteen (15) calendar days following its publication either in the Official Gazette or in a newspaper of general circulation.
