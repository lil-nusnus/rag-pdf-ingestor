### MEMORANDUM NO. M-2023-009

To : All Banks and Non-Banks with Quasi-Banking Functions (NBQBs)

Subject : Collection of the Annual Supervision Fees (ASF) for the Year 2023

Pursuant to Section 28 of the Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7653, ‘The New Central Bank Act”, as amended by R.A. No. 11211, the following guidelines shall govern the computation and collection by the Bangko Sentral Ng Pilipinas (BSP) and the payment by Banks and NBQBs of the 2023 ASF.

1. Computation of ASF for 2023 The ASF is based on the Average Assessable Assets (AAA) of the

preceding year multiplied by the applicable assessment rates ### approved by the Monetary Board as follows:

Type of Financial Institution Applicable Rate Universal/ Commercial Banks 1/28 of 1% Digital Banks 1/28 of 1% Thrift Banks 1/28 of 1% Rural/ Cooperative Banks 1/40 of 1% NBQBs 1/28 of 1%

The AAA of the preceding year is derived from the reports’ submitted by the Bank/NBQB to the BSP in compliance with the standards and requirements prescribed under existing regulations. Pursuant to Memorandum No. M-2021-065 dated 23 November 20217, the 2023 ASF shall be reduced by deducing the average amount of basic deposit account (BDA) maintained by the bank in the preceding year from the Bank's AAA. For this purpose, the average amount of BDA maintained in the preceding year will be computed based on the bank’s BDA balance as of quarter-end reporting period and adjusted by a multiplier of 5.

In case of a merger or consolidation, the assets of the covered institutions prior to the merger or consolidation as well as the assets

1 Financial Reporting Package (FRP) for banks, Consolidated Statement of Condition (CSOC) for NBQBs, and FRP for Trust Institution (FRPTI) of banks and NBQBs with trust functions * Temporary Regulatory Relief for Banks that offer Basic Deposit Accounts

## Page 2

Classification: GENERAL

of the newly formed institution shall be considered in determining the AAA. In case of upgrading or downgrading, the assets from one bank category to another shall likewise be considered in determining the AAA.

The collection of the 2023 ASF also takes into consideration events subsequent to the collection of the 2022 ASF that would warrant a recomputation. In such cases, the resulting over or under-payment of last year ASF shall be deducted/added to this year’s ASF.

Sample computations to illustrate potential scenarios are provided in Annex A.

2.Notification of Amount Due for 2023 and Mode of Payment

The BSP Department of Supervisory Analytics (DSA) shall send a billing notice in April 2023 to the Bank/NBQB for its ASF payment indicating, among others, the computation of the ASF due, the period covered by the ASF and the specific date when the ASF will be debited from the Bank’s/NBQB’s Demand Deposit Account (DDA) with the BSP.

The BSP will not accept checks as mode of ASF payment. Banks/NBQBs, upon receipt of the ASF billing notice from the BSP, should maintain adequate balance in their DDA to cover the ASF and other daily obligations and, when necessary, make corresponding deposits to fully cover said obligations. In case of deficiency, the provisions on DDA deficiency in Section 1101 and Section 1101-Q of the Manual of Regulations for Banks (MORB) and Manual of Regulations for Non-Bank Financial Institutions (MORNBEFI), respectively, as amended, shall apply.

3.Exceptions Noted on Billing Notice of 2023 ASF

Upon receipt of the BSP Notice of ASF billing, a Bank/NBQB is encouraged to check the accuracy of the billing and to submit any of the noted exceptions therein not later than ten (10) working days before the specified date of collection/debit to DDA as indicated in the billing notice.

The said exceptions, together with supporting documents, shall be e-mailed to dsa-srog@bsp.gov.ph using the following prescribed subject format - ASF 2023-Noted Exceptions<space><BSFI Name>

For Example,

To : dsa-srog@bsp.gov.ph Subject : ASF2023-Noted Exceptions ABC Bank

Page 2 of 3

## Page 3

Any exceptions received after the cut-off date or any exceptions not duly substantiated with documents before the cut- off date will be evaluated and considered in the computation of the ASF for the immediately succeeding year.

This Memorandum shall take effect immediately.

For strict compliance.
