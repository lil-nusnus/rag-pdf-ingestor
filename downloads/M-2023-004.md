### MEMORANDUM NO. M-2023-004

To : ALL BANKS

Subject : Submission of Prudential Reports Using Extensible Mark-up Language (XML) format through Application Programming Interface (API)

BSP Memorandum No. M-2021-052 dated 6 October 2021 informs that the BSP has adopted initiatives to efficiently gather and process information from BSP supervised financial institutions (BSFIs), which include the migration to the Application Programming Interface (API)-based prudential report submission.

Memorandum No. M-2021-052 provides information on the general requirements to migrate to APl-based submission and the expectation that banks should complete the requirements under Items Ill (Minimum = Technical Requirements) and IV (Skill Sets Required) of the said issuance within six (6) months from the start of development. These requirements include two major activities as ### follows:

1. Connection to the BSP system and submission of the required report along with the digital certificate to identify the sender; and

2. Compliance of the XML report format with the BSP reporting standards that include adherence to the XSD (XML Schema Design) and the corresponding validation rules.

In this respect, banks are enjoined to complete the foregoing requirements in preparation for the live implementation of the API-based submission of prudential ### reports following the schedule below (Please see Annex A for details):

1. Parallel run of the new FRPv15, which shall be used for the API based submission shall cover the March 2023 quarter-end reports and the April and May 2023 month-end reports. The FRPv15 shall be submitted within 20 (for solo basis) and 35 (for consolidated basis) banking days from end of the reference period, as applicable.

2. The existing FRPv14.5 and covered FRP-related reports (Annex B) being submitted through the Financial Institutions Portal (Fl Portal)/Email submission pursuant to existing submission guidelines shall continue to be considered as the official submission of banks for the March 2023 quarter-end and the April and May 2023 month-end reports.

3. The Live submission! of the FRPv15 shall start with the June 2023 quarter-end and July 2023 month-end reports. The FRPv14.5 and covered FRP-related reports shall no longer be submitted beginning the said periods.

4. Banks may use the XML Converter Facility of the BSP under the BSP Relationship

Management System - Integral Financial Supervision System (BRMS-IFSS) web ### portal for the submission of the FRPv15 subject to the following conditions:

1 Separate submission guidelines will be issued to formalize the live implementation.

## Page 2

a. Universal/Commercial banks (UKBs) and Digital Banks (DBs) and their subsidiary thrift and rural/cooperative banks may use the converter facility during the parallel run of the FRPv15. Beginning with the live implementation of the FRPv15 reports for the reporting period ending 30 June 2023, the BSP XML Converter Facility will no longer be available to U/KBs and DBs and their subsidiary thrift and rural/cooperative banks and, as such, they shall use their own XML facility and shall submit the same via the API facility.

b. The submission of the generated XML report using machine-to-machine modality by UKBs, DBs, and their subsidiary banks for both the parallel run and live implementation shall be done using the bankâ€™s own process as coordinated with the BSP or via the approach introduced by the BSP using Postman protocol.

5. Other thrift/rural/cooperative banks may use the BSP XML Converter and submit their XML reports via Web Auxiliary facility (BSP Relationship Management System or BRMS) provided by the BSP during the parallel run and live implementation until further notice.

6. Any changes to the abovementioned schedule or other related matters shall be communicated accordingly.

For guidance and compliance.
