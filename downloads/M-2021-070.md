XML Schema Definition or XSD - This contains the technical specifications which will serve as building blocks in generating the report in XML file format. The XSD shall be available in the BSP Template Portal (www.bsp.gov.ph/SES/reporting_templates) or requested directly from the Credit Reporting System Unit (CRSU)

through crsu@bsp.gov.ph.

Data Dictionary (see Annex A) - This serves as a supporting document of the XSD which presents the specifications of data element names, data types, and acceptable values of the COCREE Report in a tabular form.

Line-item Instructions (see Annex B) - This provides a comprehensive guide in accomplishing the COCREE Report and covers relevant details and description of each data element.

Control Prooflist or CP (see Annex C) - This document, which will be submitted in PDF together with the XML file, requires authorized signatories to certify the total number of records and submission type of the XML file/s and that all matters declared in the COCREE Report are true and correct.

Validation User Guide (see Annex D) - This describes the validation process and illustrates common validation errors with corresponding interpretation and resolution to address these exceptions.

Frequently Asked Questions or FAQ (see Annex E) - This provides a baseline list of queries, with corresponding responses, which BSFlis may encounter in the preparation, accomplishment, and/or submission of the COCREE.

4) Report submissions that do not conform to the above prescribed procedures shall not be accepted and shall be considered non-compliant with the BSP reporting requirements as prescribed under Section 171 of the MORB and Section 172-Q of the MORNBFI. Only the file format prescribed by the BSP for the COCREE Report shall be accepted as compliant with the existing reportorial requirements of the BSP subject to validation and applicable penalties for erroneous, delayed and/or unsubmitted reporting.

To prepare for the effectivity of the COCREE Report, BSFls can pilot test their XML submissions with the BSP. This will involve the iterative process of submitting COCREE-XML test reports to the BSP and addressing the exceptions noted in the BSP validation.

Pilot testing period of the COCREE-XML through the FI Portal will start in February 2022 and end in May 2022. BSFls can test using records as of reporting period 30 June 2021. Only after the submitted records as of reporting period 30 June 2021 have successfully passed validation can the BSFI proceed to test the records of the subsequent reporting period which, for pilot testing purposes, shall refer to the next reporting quarter (ie, records as of period ended 30 September 202] after record's as of period ended 30 June 202] have passed validation, followed by records as of period ending 31 December 202] after records as of period ended 30 September 202] have passed validation)

Records covering reporting periods 30 June 2021 to 31 December 2021 submitted during the pilot phase are primarily for testing purposes only and will not be considered as a live submission of the COCREE Report.

Penalties for reporting violations of the COCREE Report shall not be imposed during the pilot period. A grace period for non- imposition of penalties for reporting violations of the COCREE Report shall also be observed for the first three reporting periods of its live submissions (i.e., reporting periods 31 March, 30 April, and 31 May 2022). Imposition of penalties for reporting violations of the COCREE submission shall be strictly enforced beginning with reporting period 30 June 2022.

During the pilot period and live implementation of the COCREE, the Report on CREDEX' shall continue to be submitted quarterly in accordance with its existing deadline and reporting rules until otherwise advised by the Bangko Sentral.

### BANGKO SENTRAL NG PILIPINAS

Comprehensive Credit and Equity Exposures (COCREE) Report

Line-Item Instructions

Accomplishment of the Report

1.

The report shall include credit and equity exposures of the covered BSP-supervised financial institution (BSFI).

The report shall be accomplished on a solo basis by the Universal/Commercial Banks (UKBs) and their Thrift Bank (TBs)/ Non-bank Financial Institutions with Quasi-banking Functions (NBQBs)/ Trust Corporation subsidiaries, and the Digital Banks.

BSFls shall report exposures to resident and non-resident borrowers. Foreign currency denominated exposures shall be reported in both the original currency and Philippine peso equivalent.

All amounts, except written-off accounts with nominal value, shall be reported. These should be in absolute figures with two (2) decimal places, except if explicitly provided in the Data Dictionary that the specific data element can have more than 2 decimal places (e.g., probability of default and interest rate).

Information is either mandatory/required (M), optional/applicable but not required (O), or are not applicable (N) for submission as indicated in the Data Dictionary (DD). The use of default values indicating unavailability of data for legacy accounts, among other considerations, shall be permitted for the purpose of capturing other available information submitted by BSFls. The submission of default values, however, shall be closely monitored by the Bangko Sentral, subject to the provisions of BSP Cir. No. 963, to maintain the overall quality of data.

Information shall be submitted in alphanumeric (A), string (S), numeric (N), date (D), or memo (M) form with acceptable values as indicated in the data dictionary.

For the Exposure Information, the elements are either Dynamic or Static. Static elements are stable data elements which do not change throughout the life cycle of the exposure. (e.g., promisory note number, purpose of the loan, transaction type, date granted, amount granted, acquisition amount). Hence, static data elements

## Page 86

Annex B

shall only be reported once (e.g., at the onset of reporting and upon new loan grant/investment acquired). All Dynamic data elements shall be reported monthly as they are active data elements requiring periodic updates throughout the life cycle of the exposure (e.g., outstanding balance).

7. The file naming convention of COCREE Reports in XML format is COCREE_YYYYMM_BankAcronym_lofX.xml where “YYYYMM’” is the reference year and month, and the X in “lofX” is the total number of XML files for submission in the reference period with sample shown below for ABC Bank which submits records for the 31 March 2022 ### reference period:

### Single-XML file Submission: COCREE_202203_ABC_lofl.xml

### Three-XML file Submission:

COCREE_202203_ABC_lof3.xml (for records 1 to I0OO) COCREE_202203_ABC_2of3.xml (for records 100] to 2000) COCREE_202203_ABC_3of3.xml (for records 2000] to 3000)

The file naming convention of Control Prooflist is COCREE_YYYYMM_<Bank acronym>_Control Prooflist.pdf (e.g., COCREE_202203_ABC_Control Prooflist.pdf)

8. The use of Reserved Words in XML is not allowed. Reserved Words in a programming language have fixed meaning and cannot be redefined hence, should be transformed in COCREE Reporting as

a. If there are updates/amendments in any of the previously submitted Subject Information, the full string of mandatory data elements shall be re-submitted together with the updated/amended information;

b. If there are updates in the previously submitted Exposure Information (e.g., change in outstanding balance due to amortization payment, change in accumulated gains/losses, upgrade in credit limit, among others), the submission of the full string of information is no longer necessary.

## Page 88

Annex B

c. If there is a new exposure for an existing Subject, BSFls shall report the related fi/ing/nfo, subject/D, and the full string of

Exposure information.

Submission After the Release of Validation Results

The system being used in the COCREE saves the information of the Subject (i.e, Subject, Exposure and Negative Information) only if the entire information string of the Subject passes the Stage 2 Validation.

In addressing the remaining validation exceptions, the records of the Subject that already passed the Stage 2 Validation should not be resubmitted unless there are amendments/updates in the submitted information, in which case, the submitType=1 (UPDATE) shall be used.

If exceptions were noted in Stage 1 or 2 Validation in any of the information of the Subject, the entire data string of the Subject in the current submission is rejected and is not saved in the system. In resubmitting the information, submitType=O (NEW) or submitType=1 (UPDATE) shall be used following the Rules on the Submission Type in Items 4.a and 4.b above.

Please note that each XML file shall bear only 1 submitType (e.g., XML 1 of 2 - submitType=0, XML 2 of 2 - submitType=1)

To Delete Erroneously Submitted Records

For records previously submitted and passed the validation but were later found to be erroneous, BSFlIs shall use delete/nfo. Kindly note that for the de/ete/nfo, all the data strings pertaining to the subject/ID and/or contractNo submitted for the reference period shall be deleted. In resubmitting the information, submitType=0 (NEW) or submitType=l1 (UPDATE) shall be used following the Rules on the Submission Type in Items 4.a and 4.b above.

For corrections that cover multiple reference periods, an XML file for each period shall be submitted (e.g., an error in the record uploaded for the reference periods 31 March and 30 April 2022 will require the submission of two XML files using the de/ete/nfo) The Bank shall then immediately submit two more XML files using the submitType=0O (NEW) and/or submitType=1 (UPDATE) to reflect the correct information.

A. XSD Specifications

In relation to the thrust of the Bangko Sentral to enhance the supervisory reporting platforms and tools to strengthen surveillance activities, the COCREE will utilize extensive markup language (XML) format. In lieu of data entry templates (DETs) which are traditionally used for report submission, the XML Schema Definition (XSD) is provided to serve as building blocks in generating the report in XML file format. It describes the technical specifications, including the prescribed data elements. data types, and valid/acceptable values. Accompanying the XSD is the Data Dictionary which describes the business specifications in tabular presentation.

B. Submission

BSP-Supervised Financial Institutions (BSFls) shall use the respective registered credentials in the submission of COCREE Report through the Financial Institution (Fl) Portal. As voluminous data are expected, multiple submissions of XML file shall be allowed in accordance with the instructions stated in the Line-Item Instructions (Annex B). Processing in the FI Portal shall be on a first file upload, first process basis. BSFls should note that each uploaded file must not exceed two (2) GB in size. The report shall undergo the 2-stage validation to ensure compliance with the prescribed technical structure (Stage 1) and the established logical rules (Stage 2).

C. Stage 1 Validation - XML Structure and Conformity with XSD

Stage 1 Validation ensures the conformity of the uploaded file vis-a-vis XSD specifications. Errors may arise from the use of erroneous values and data types, inaccurate sequence in reporting the information, and presence of malformations. Validation report containing the list of exceptions shall be released to the BSFI through the FI Portal no later than three (3) days after the submission of the report. Shown below is a

Figure C.2.1b. Invalid values - Exposure Information

Figure C.2.1b illustrates an invalid value for the Loan Regulatory Status (statCode) data element. As defined in the Data Dictionary (Annex A), the accepted values for statCode are: CR, PD, NPL, and ITL. If the status is current, the value shall be reported as ‘CR’ and not ‘CUR”.

C.2.2, On XML Malformation

BSFls should submit a well-formed XML file which observes the general XML syntax rules. It should be noted that the system will stop the validation upon detection of malformation in the submitted report. The following are sample instances of ### malformation:

e Missing Root Element An XML file has only one (1) root element that defines the

type of report being submitted. It encapsulates other elements meaning, these other elements shall be present within the opening and closing tag of the root element. The opening tag begins with a left-angle bracket (<) to be followed by an element name and closes with a right- angle bracket (>). The closing tag on the other hand, is the same as the opening tag but with a slash (/) prior the element name.

To illustrate, the root element in Figure C.2.2a below is the <root>, Other elements are declared within its opening tag, <root>and closing tag, </root>.

<root> <child> <subchild>..... </subchild> </child>

</root>

## Page 110

Annex D

In Figure C.2.2b the <credex202/> is the root element. Other child and sub-child elements are within the opening tag and closing tag of the root element.

<credex2021> <bkcode>88008< /bkcode> <trdate>2021-06-30</trdate> <totSubjectRecords>9038</totSubjectRecords>

<totExposureRecords>34562</totExposureRecords> <totNegativeRecords >@</totNegativeRecords> </credex2@21>

Figure C.2.2b Root Element

. se _ In an XML file, when an element is declared or opened, it must also be closed. Any unclosed tags will cause malformation in the XML.

For example, in Figure C.2.2c, the Given ID (idGiven) element is properly closed with the </dGiven> tag. However, it can be noted that the Negative Information (negativelnfo) has no end-tag. As a result, the submitting BSFI will receive a validation report indicating the exception noted, as illustrated in Figure C.2.2d.

<subjectId subjectId="00000011867162"> <negativelInfo> <noInfo negativeType="0"></noInfo> <subjectInfo> ### <I> <idGiven> <tin>000269043281</tin> </idGiven>

Annex D

Whitespace is a collection of spaces, tabs and new lines which are generally used to make an XML file more readable. For instance, the use of indentations for child elements or space in between words in an Address. When using whitespaces in the values of data elements, BSFls should ensure that these whitespaces are valid values as specified in the XSD. Improper use of whitespaces will result in errors in validation.

For example, as shown in Figure C.2.2e below, the system did not continue the validation past the line error of the Currency (curr) element due to the _ insignificant whitespace after the element name. The valid value accepted is only ‘USD’ without any trailing spaces. As a result, submitting BSFI will receive a validation report illustrated in Figure C.2.2f.

Annex D

The elements in the XML are case sensitive. They need to be exactly in the same case as defined in the XSD, else, the submitted report will be considered as malformed and will fail the validation.

For example, the BSFI declared the letter “N” in Negative Information in uppercase, <Negative/nfo>. In this instance, the report will be malformed considering that the allowed reporting of letter “N” in Negative Information should be in lowercase <negativelnfo>.

C.2.3. On Hierarchal Structure

XML follows a hierarchal structure. This structure is also called as the XML Tree. BSFls shall strictly observe the XML Tree as defined in the XSD. Otherwise, the submitted report will fail the validation.

For instance, as defined in the XSD, the Exposure Information (exposure/nfo) follows a sequence wherein Loans (Loan) should be reported first to be followed by Other Credit Accommodation (OtherCred) Debt and Equity Investment (/nvestments) Off- Balance Sheet (Off-BS) and Credit Card (CredCard!) Exposures. However, BSFI reported its exposure/nfo in the sequence as shown in Figure C.2.3a.

It should be noted that the system runs the validation on a per file basis. If the file passed the Stage 1 Validation, it would automatically proceed to the Stage 2 Validation. The XML report that failed the Stage 1 Validation will not proceed to the Stage 2 Validation until all exceptions noted in the specific file have been resolved.

For example, the BSFI submitted four (4) XML files for the reference period 30 June 2021. During the Stage 1 Validation, the system detected malformation in File No. 2. As a result, only File Nos. 1, 3 and 4 will continue to Stage 2 Validation. File No. 2 will only proceed to Stage 2 Validation until the error has been resolved.

The system will generate validation report per file and per validation stage. In our example, File No. 2 will have a Stage 1 Validation Report and the rest of the file will have the results of the Stage 2 Validation.

D. Stage 2 Validation - Logical Checks

Reports which passed the Stage 1 Validation, will undergo the Stage 2 Validation wherein the submitted data will be assessed vis-a-vis the logical rules listed in Section D.1. User Guide to interpret the validation results is presented in Section D.2 and sample Validation Reports are provided in Section D.3, for the guidance of the BSFls.

BSFls should address the defects and errors listed in the Stage 2 Validation Report and resubmit the corrected data records. Subjects which were not cited in the Stage 2 Validation Report have passed the validation, hence, should not be resubmitted unless there are subsequent updates/amendments.

The submission and validation chain of the COCREE was designed to minimize manual validation and human intervention. However, exceptions in BSFIls’ submission may still be discovered post-facto the system-generated validation. In such cases, BSFls will be notified to address the identified data quality issues.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQs) ### COMPREHENSIVE CREDIT ### AND EQUITY EXPOSURES (COCREE) REPORT

### RATIONALE, REPORT COVERAGE AND SUBMISSION TIMELINE

1.

What is the rationale of updating the Report on Credit and Equity Exposures to’ Individuals/Companies/Groups aggregating P1.0 million and above (CREDEX)? What is the difference between the CREDEX and the COCREE?

The COCREE requires more granular credit information to support Bangko Sentral’s supervisory mandate including _ statistical, research and policy development. Data submission is made more frequent, from quarterly to monthly, for access to more timely and recent information. Also, better technological tools will be used to collect and process data to increase efficiency in the submission and processing of reports.

. Will the CREDEX threshold of reporting only accounts

aggregating to P1.0 million and above still apply to the COCREE? The threshold amount of P1.0 million and above will no longer apply. All amounts, except written-off accounts with nominal value, shall be submitted for the COCREE Report.

Will BSFIs continue to submit the CREDEX report?

Yes, the CREDEX Report shall continue to be submitted in accordance with its existing deadline and reporting rules until otherwise advised by the Bangko Sentral. BSP-supervised financial institutions (BSFIs) covered in CREDEX Reporting, namely the Universal/Commercial Banks (UKBs), Thrift Banks (TB), Non-bank Financial Institutions with Quasi-banking Functions (NBQB), Investment Houses with Trust Functions, and other NBFls that are subsidiaries or affiliates of UKBs, TBs or NBQBs, shall continue to submit the quarterly CREDEX report.

. Inthe maiden reporting with reference period 31 March 2022, will

BSFls only update the records already submitted in the pilot test? No, the official maiden submission of the COCREE Report will be for the reporting period 31 March 2022. All Subject, Exposure and Negative Information of subjects with outstanding balance as of 31 March 2022 and/or incurred negative event in March 2022 shall be submitted and considered as new submission.

. When can BSFlIs expect feedback on the submitted report?

The validation results will be released within three (3) working days upon the Bangko Sentral’s receipt of the COCREE Report.

Yes, the F/ Code refers to the same 6-digit BSFI code (bkcode) being used in the regular reporting to the Bangko Sentral.

### SUBJECT INFORMATION

2.

Is it possible to duplicate subject ID, as there are accounts with the same subject ID coming from different branches?

No. It is advised that BSFls provide a subject ID number for each unique Subject as this will be the basis of our system to aggregate all the information of the unique Subject. It is suggested to separate subjects with the same number such as add digits anchored on other attributes (e.g., originating branch).

What Borrower/Counterparty Type should banks fall under? Banks are classified as Corporation.

. How should BSFIs map the borrower/counterparty as to Resident

Type?

Annex E

15. Is the Appraised Value of the Collateral also mandatory to non-REM? Yes. The Appraised Value of the Collateral is mandatory to all Secured Loans.

16. How should BSFls report account with overpayments? Overpayments shall not be reported since these are not considered loans but liabilities.

17. How should BSFIs report active accounts with zero (O) balance? These accounts shall not be reported unless they have incurred negative event in the month of the reference period (e.g., when collateral was foreclosed in the reference month to fully settle the loan, the information on the loan with nil outstanding balance as of the end of reference month, will no longer be reported, but an entry for negative information shall be reported).

Off-Balance Sheet Exposure

18. What is the definition of each account type for Off-Balance Sheet Exposure in Annex A-IX (List of Contingent Account Type) since some values are in general terms such as value F=>Commitments? The definition of off-balance sheet accounts under Off-Balance Sheet Exposure in Annex A-IX follows the definition of accounts under Schedule 38 of the FRP.

Debt and Equity Investments

19. On Derivatives Contingent, particularly on transactions involving

two foreign currencies, such as the purchase of one FX vs the sale of another FX (e.g., buy USD/sell JPY), where both legs are reported in the FRP, is it acceptable that the contract no. be reported twice to be consistent with the requirements of the FRP under Memorandum No. M-2008-009? As defined under Manual of Accounts of the FRP, “the Foreign Exchange Contracts refer to contracts to purchase/sell foreign currencies in the forward market in an over the counter or an organized exchange. A purchase of foreign currency is equivalent to a sale of Philippine currency. A transaction involving two foreign currencies is treated as two separate foreign exchange contracts against Philippine currency.“

Similar to the reporting in FRP, BSFls are required to report both legs

of transactions in COCREE Reporting, treated as two separate transactions, and these can have the same contract number.

il. TRANSACTION SPECIFIC

1. Are the following accounts included in the COCREE? ### Responses are provided in the right column as follows:

Accounts Included?

On-balance sheet Real and Other Properties Owned No Real Estate Investment - Land No Investment in Real Estate Building & No Improvements Accrued Interest Receivables Yes Dividends Receivables No Sales Contracts Receivables Yes Accounts Receivables No Other Miscellaneous Assets No Interbank Call and Term Loans Yes Reverse Repurchase Agreement No Due from Other Banks Yes Investments in Subsidiaries/Associates No

COCREE: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) ver. 1.0 Page 6 of 15

## Page 131

Annex E

Accounts Included? Loans directed by the Trustors or Principals Yes and funded by their own respective Trust or Investment Management Accounts, and within their authorities under the Trust or Investment Management Agreement

2. For Shipside Bonds and Airway Bills Guaranteed Issued, there are two (2) possible values that BSFIs can use as per Annex A-IX, which are va/ue A (Guarantees Issued) or value E (Trade Related Guarantees). Which is more appropriate for each?

Schedule 38 of the FRP requires Shipside Bond/Airway Bills to be reported under 7rade Related Guarantees. The reporting in COCREE should be consistent with the reporting in FRP.

3. How should BSFls report unavailable mandatory data elements,

such as those not previously collected and arising from “legacy” accounts? A default value is assigned for such accounts. Please refer to the Data Dictionary and Line-/tem Instructions. The use of default values indicating unavailability of data is not ideal but shall be allowed for the purpose of accepting the other information available. This, however, shall be closely monitored by the Bangko Sentral, subject to the provisions of BSP Cir. No. 963, to maintain the overall quality of data.

4. What should BSFIs report for transactions with unavailable information for date of grant/amount granted? BSFls shall use the last known information by the BSFI for the date of opening and/or amount granted (e.g., date of system migration which deleted the previous records).

5. For Trust units/entities, is Time Deposit - Own Bank included? If yes, will this be classified under Other Credit Accommodation? For Trust units/entities, the Time Deposit-Own Bank is not included in COCREE Reporting. Although Due from Other Banks (DFOB) are required to be reported as mentioned in Item No. IIl.1, the time deposits in the same bank do not fall under the definition of DFOB per Manual of Accounts of the FRP for Trust Institutions, as these exposures are booked in another account, the “Deposits in Banks - Resident Banks - Own Bank’.

### AGGREGATION OF ACCOUNTS

6. Is the aggregation of accounts (e.g., Loans, Investments) still applicable in the COCREE? If so, what will be the basis of aggregation?

Yes, the aggregation of exposures of unique subject shall be performed by the Bangko Sentral through our system’s matching

COCREE: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) ver. 1.0 Page 7 of 15

## Page 132

Annex E

algorithm. In this regard, BSFls should ensure the reporting of mandatory information as indicated in the Data Dictionary and Line-ltem Instructions to facilitate the effective matching of exposures to unique subject.

### IV. SYSTEMS, TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS AND REPORT FILING

1. How many stages are there in the validation process? Validation process consists of two (2) Stages. Stage 1 structurally validates the report against the XSD specifications, while Stage 2 covers logical validation. Please refer to the detailed validation guidelines.

2. Will the Bangko Sentral provide validation rules and a program to validate the correctness of the file submitted? On the validation rules, the Stage 1 Validation is based on the rules embedded in the XSD. It can be noted that the XSD file along with the Data Dictionary already contain the structure and the valid values of the report. On the other hand, Rules in the Stage 2 Validation are provided in the detailed validation guidelines (see Annex D).

On the validation program, the Bangko Sentral will not provide a program that will validate the submitted file. BSFls are expected to adopt tools that will ensure the compliance vis-a-vis XSD specification and logical rules.

3. Should extra characters be ignored if the length of the information reported is greater than the length assigned by the Bangko Sentral?

No, the data length per element was evaluated based on its possible length. Should there be a record that exceeds the length provided, BSFls shall immediately inform the Bangko Sentral to make the necessary adjustments in order to avoid deletion of extra characters.

Annex E

5. How should BSFIls report information with multiple transactions? Should BSFIs report it all at once or on a per transaction basis? The XSD was designed to accommodate the submission of multiple information related to a single Subject in one (1) XML file. In the submission of BSFls, it is expected that the entire string of information of a single Subject (i.e., Subject, Exposure, Negative) is incorporated in one (1) XML file.

In case there will be difficulty in combining multiple exposure information of a unique Subject in one (1) XML file, BSFls can divide the exposure information in different XML files. For instance, Borrower 1 is included in XML1 of 2 which contains his housing loan and XML 2 of 2 which contains his credit card. In this submission, BSFls must ensure that the information of the unique borrower in XML 1 of 2 has passed Stage 2 Validation so that the system can recognize and append the additional exposure information reported in XML 2 of 2. The subsequent report (KML 2 of 2) would then need to use submitType =1 (UPDATE) to append the additional exposure of the unique subjectID, similar to Scenario B in Item No. 4 of the Report Submission FAQ.

6. Can BSFIs leave blank the optional data fields? No, specific data fields with no record should be excluded in the XML submission. Leaving the record as ‘b/ank’ will result in an error as seen in the sample below.

7. Will the COCREE accept two (2) XML files that have the same bkcode and trdate? Or will the Bangko Sentral’s system assume those XML files as duplicate submissions?

BSFI can submit more than one (1) XML file. Submission of multiple XML files using the prescribed file naming conventions will not be treated as duplicate. Each XML file will be provided with submission reference number for proper monitoring of the status and validation results.

8. What will be the pro forma of the COCREE? Will it be by forms like

the CREDEX wherein Loans, Investments, Equity Holdings, Contingent are reported separately? The COCREE will be submitted in XML format following the prescribed technical specifications in the XSD provided by the Bangko Sentral. Unlike the CREDEX wherein each form is submitted separately, the XML file of the COCREE shall contain all the required records.

9. What will be the file naming convention that will be sent to the Bangko Sentral? The file naming convention is COCREE_YYYYMM_BankAcronym_1lofX.xml where “YYYYMM’” is the reference year and month, and the X in “lofxX’” is the total number of XML files for submission in the reference period, with sample shown ### below:

### For Single-XML file Submission: COCREE_202203_ABC_lofl.xml

### For Three-XML file Submission:

COCREE_202203 ABC_lof3.xml (for records 1 to 1000) COCREE_202203 ABC _2o0f3.xml (for records 1001 to 2000) COCREE_202203 ABC _3o0f3.xml (for records 20001 to 3000)

The file naming convention of the Control Prooflist is COCREE_YYYYMM_<Bank acronym>_Control Prooflist.pdf (e.g., COCREE_202203_ ABC_Control Prooflist.pdf)

10. Will the COCREE have a Control Prooflist?

COCREE, classified as an A-1 Report, should be submitted together with the Control Prooflist as attached in Annex C of this Memorandum. Further, there is an embedded Control Prooflist in the XML file which requires BSFls to declare the number of submitted records (eg., totSubjectRecords, totNegativeRecords, and totExposureRecords) in the filing information portion. This declaration will be matched against the actual count of records in the submitted XML file. The system will not proceed with the validation if there are discrepancies in the count of actual records vis-a-vis the declared number of records.

Tl. Can BSFIis get a copy of the new template format to help

branch (e.g., HK Law on Data Privacy which prohibits absolute disclosure of client’s information)? Yes, BSFls shall observe the local laws of their branches located outside the Philippines. Specific information that are not disclosed in view of this should be justified and coordinated with the Bangko Sentral.

of which may be prohibited under bank secrecy laws. Are these necessary for Bangko Sentral statistical and policy development purposes? Yes, these are essential as discussed in the rationale of the COCREE Reporting. In addition to Section 3 of the Republic Act (RA) 7653, as amended by 11211, otherwise known as "The New Central Bank Act", which provides for the collection by the Bangko Sentral of relevant information from covered institutions, Section 60 of The General Banking Law (GBL) likewise provides for the submission of periodic formatted reports to the Bangko Sentral in pursuit of exercising its supervisory authority. It is further worth noting that the Bank Secrecy Law or RA 1405 (An Act Prohibiting disclosure with any Banking Institution and Providing Penalty Therefor) refers to deposit products. The COCREE, on the other hand, applies to credit, equity, and off-balance sheet exposures of BSFls, and not deposit products under RA 1405.

3. The requested info in the COCREE has Personal Identifiable

Information (Pil). What security protocols are present to ensure the proper handling of BSFls’ customers’ data?
