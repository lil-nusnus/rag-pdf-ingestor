Subject: Amendments to Regulations on the Open Foreign Exchange Position of Banks

The Monetary Board, in its Resolution No. 611 dated 20 May 2021, approved the amendments to the Regulations on the Open Foreign Exchange Position of Banks.

Section 1. The Sections of Part V, Chapter Il of the Manual of Regulations on Foreign Exchange Transactions (FX Manual) on the Open ### Foreign Exchange Position of Banks shall be replaced by the following:

“Section 96. General Policy. It is the policy of the BSP to promote the growth and development of the foreign exchange market. In order to ensure that banks are able to provide ample liquidity in the market but, at the same time, conduct their business in a sound manner, banks shall manage their open foreign exchange positions in accordance with these guidelines. Banks shall likewise ensure faithful adherence to ethical standards in carrying out their foreign exchange transactions.

Section 97. Definition of Terms.

“Open Foreign Exchange Position” shall refer to the extent that banks' foreign exchange assets do not match their foreign exchange liabilities. An open position may either be "positive", "long", or "overbought" (i.e., foreign exchange assets exceed foreign exchange liabilities) or "negative", "short", or "oversold" (i.e., foreign exchange liabilities exceed foreign exchange assets).

An Authorized Agent Bank (AAB)’s “Qualifying Capital” shall be determined in accordance with the Risk-Based Capital Adequacy Framework under Appendix 59 of the Manual of Regulations for Banks.

Section 98. Computation of the Consolidated Net Open Foreign Exchange Position.

An AAB's consolidated net open foreign exchange position isthe higher.

(2)

ii. Equity investments in foreign subsidiaries;

iii. Investments in Global Peso Notes issued by the Republic of the Philippines;

iv. Foreign exchange holdings resulting from _ original investments in New Money Bonds (NMB);

V. “Due from Head Office/Branches/Agencies Abroad-Assigned Capital” account, to the extent of the lower of assigned capital approved by the BSP or the amount of capital actually remitted; and

Vi. Amount of foreign currency-denominated assets pertaining to the net proceeds of outstanding issues of foreign currency denominated Additional Tier 1 capital instruments.

Contingent FX assets and contingent FX liabilities, including forward purchases and sales, which shall be reported at notional amount;

### Options positions, in accordance with the following:

a. AABs with Dealer Authority to write options shall include the net delta weighted positions of their foreign currency options.

b. AABs without the said authority shall include the notional amounts of all options positions that are in or at the money and exclude those that are out of the money;

Net position in outstanding foreign currency-denominated derivatives other than FX forwards, FX swaps and FX options, which shall be reported as the difference between (a) the positive fair value and (b) the negative fair value of these contracts; and

over such institutions. This item shall likewise include the net open foreign currency position of any entity that is engaged in foreign exchange trading or is a foreign exchange corporation that is affiliated with the AAB either by ownership, management control, or influence by the AAB itself or its retirement fund, officers, directors, or shareholders.

Section 99. Net Open Foreign Exchange Position Limit. A bank's consolidated net open foreign exchange position (either overbought or oversold) shall not exceed 25 percent (25%) of its Qualifying Capital or USD150.0 million, whichever is lower.

AABs shall use the Qualifying Capital as of the month-end two months prior to the reporting date to determine the net foreign exchange position limit. For example, the amount of Qualifying Capital as of the end of January shall be the basis of the limit for all the days in March.

A bank's consolidated net open foreign exchange position shall be computed on a daily basis based on its FX Form 1. The reporting requirements are outlined in Appendix 19 of the FX Manual, while Appendix 19.1 provides an illustrative example of the computation of the net open position.

Section 100. Supervisory Framework. The Bangko Sentral shall monitor AABs' compliance with the net open foreign exchange position limit set out under Section 99 of the FX Manual.

The Bangko Sentral will pay particular attention to AABs that breach the limit five (5) times within a 20-banking day period. The 20-banking day period shall be reckoned on a rolling basis. The Bangko Sentral shall ### evaluate the instances of breaches, with due regard to the following:

e The frequency and the gravity of the breaches;

e The underlying cause/s of the breaches and the extent to which these are consistent with the AAB's declared business strategies;

e The strength of the AAB’s risk management system; and

e Actions taken by the AAB, if any, to address the breaches and restore compliance with the limit.

Consistent with Section 002 of the Manual of Regulations for Banks, the Bangko Sentral may deploy supervisory actions to ensure that foreign exchange risk does not threaten an AAB's safety and soundness. The Bangko Sentral may recommend corrective actions, curtail activities that
