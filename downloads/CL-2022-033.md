### ENDORSEMENT OF THE BSP OF THE SOUNDNESS OF THE ABOVE LISTED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. The accreditation cannot be used for any purpose other than for implementing the provisions of the Agri-Agra Reform Credit Act of 2009 and its related rules and regulations.

Under existing regulations, the lending and/or investing bank is required to disclose in its Agri-Agra Report submitted to the BSP its exposure to the accredited RFI along with the corresponding ARN of said RFI, should such lending and/or investing bank intend to utilize its exposure for agri-agra compliance. Such exposure to the accredited RFI shall be eligible for determining compliance with the agri-agra requirement for as long as the said RFI remains accredited. The accreditation is valid until sooner revoked for non-renewal or non- compliance with the qualification requirements prescribed under

existing rules and regulations. In the event of disaccreditation, the lending/investing bank will be allowed to use its exposure to a disaccredited RFI for compliance with the agri-agra requirement only up to the next reporting quarter following the disaccreditation as a grace period. The Agri-Agra Report of the lending/investing bank shall be deemed defective if a disaccredited RFI is declared and used for compliance with the agri-agra requirement beyond the said grace period. Hence, the above list of accredited RFls and their corresponding ARNs are being issued for reference and guidance of lending and/or investing banks.

The above updated list of RFls accredited by the BSP and ACPC supersedes those listed under Circular Letter No. CL-2022-010 dated
