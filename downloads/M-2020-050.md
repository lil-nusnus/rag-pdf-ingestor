Subject : Regulatory Relief through Temporary Relaxation of the Maximum Borrowing Limit of Pawnshops

The Monetary Board, in its Resolution No. 743 dated 11 June 2020, approved the grant of regulatory relief for Pawnshops through the relaxation of their maximum borrowing limit by increasing the allowed percentage of their total borrowings to pledge loans from 50 percent? to 70 percent until 31 December 2021.
