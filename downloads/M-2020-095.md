### MEMORANDUM NO. M — 2020 - 095. Series of 2020

To : All Participants of the Philippine Payment and Settlement System (PhilPaSS)

Subject: Extension of the Temporary Relief Measure on the Transactions with PhilPaSS until the Last Business Day of Year 2021

To provide further support for the efficient operations of financial institutions and further foster a supportive environment within which BSP-supervised entities can extend improved financial intermediation services to the public and encourage the wider and broader use of digital payments, the temporary waiver of fees of fund transfer transactions made through the Phi/PaSS under the BSP Memorandum M-2020- 027 dated 21 April 2020 is extended until the last business day of year 2021.

The BSP enjoins participants of PhilPaSS to actively disseminate to the public the available automated clearing houses (i.e., InstaPay and PESONet) and PhilPaSS as facilities to electronically transfer funds to target recipient-accounts maintained with other banks participating in Phi/PaSS, thereby providing Filipinos a wide range of digital payment channels.

For information and guidance.
