### OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR

### CIRCULAR NO. 1206 Series of 2024

Subject: Consolidated Rules for Money Service Businesses (MSBs) under the New "Manual of Regulations for Non-bank Financial Institutions (MORNBFI)-M"

The Monetary Board, in its Resolution No. 1362 dated 28 November 2024, approved the attached consolidated rules for MSBs'. The consolidated rules shall be lodged under the “M-Regulations’” of the MORNBFI. The M-Regulations expunges in its entirety Sections 901-N and 902-N of the MORNBFI and puts these together with other applicable MORNBFI provisions to form an integrated set of rules bespoke to MSBs.

The constitution of the M-Regulations is anchored on the expanded regulatory and supervisory authority of the Bangko Sentral over MSBs by virtue of the enactment of Republic Act (RA) No. 11211, amending RA No. 7653 (The New Central Bank Act). Currently, the regulatory provisions for MSBs are mostly found in Sections 901-N and 902-N of the MORNBFI, together with other pertinent provisions of the N-Regulations. The integration of all these provisions in just one book, the M-Regulations, will provide supervised MSBs and stakeholders a compendium of existing rules and regulations. This will make referencing easier for better clarity of standards and requirements applicable to MSBs. The M-Regulations sets forth the regulatory framework for the Bangko Sentral’s supervision over MSBs. It is designed to accommodate regulatory enhancements match-fit for a fast-moving, complex, and at times, unpredictable risk environment of the MSBs.

Section 1. Sections 901-N on “Money Service Business Operations” and 902-N on ‘Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASP)” of the MORNBFI, and their related Appendices, are hereby deleted and superseded by the attached consolidated rules for MSBs (Annex A and its Appendices) which shall be incorporated as M-Regulations of the MORNBFI.

Section 2. Certain sections of the MORNBFI and the Manual of Regulations for Banks (MORB) with reference to Sections 901-N and/or 902-N of the MORNBFI are hereby amended, ### as follows:

002-M MONETARY PENALTIES ON MSBs, AND/OR THEIR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS ### AND/OR EMPLOYEES

The Bangko Sentral recognizes the need to impose monetary penalties as one of the possible administrative sanctions to hold MSBs, and/or their directors, officers and/or employees accountable for their conduct, deter future commission of violations, and achieve the overarching supervisory objectives of changed behavior and mitigated risks.

Pursuant to Section 37 of R.A. No. 7653, as amended, MSBs, and/or their directors, officers and/or employees may be imposed a maximum monetary penalty of ?1 million for each transactional violation or P100 thousand per calendar day for violations of a continuing nature. In case profit is gained or loss is avoided as a result of the violation, the Bangko Sentral may also impose a fine of no more than three (3) times the profit gained, or loss avoided.

To ensure fairness, consistency, and reasonableness in the imposition of monetary penalties, the Bangko Sentral takes into consideration the attendant circumstances of each case, such as the nature and gravity of the violation or irregularity and the size of the financial institution, including other aggravating and mitigating factors. Further, in accordance with Section 001-M, the Bangko Sentral may impose monetary penalties, singly or in combination with non-monetary sanctions, if appropriate.

The guidelines on the imposition of monetary penalties for violations in which

sanctions fall under Section 37 of R.A. No. 7653 (The New Central Bank Act), as amended, and other applicable laws are in Appendix M-1.

### G. SPECIFIC REGULATIONS

### 161-M_ VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS (VASP)*

Policy Staternent. It is the policy of the Bangko Sentral to provide an environment that encourages financial innovation while safeguarding the integrity and stability of the financial system. The Bangko Sentral recognizes that virtual asset (VA) systems have the potential to revolutionize the delivery of financial services by providing faster and more economical means to transfer funds, both domestic and international, and may further support financial inclusion. These benefits, however, should be considered along with the attendant risks in VAs considering the higher degree of anonymity involved, the velocity of transactions, volatility of prices, and global accessibility. It is for these reasons that the Bangko Sentral shall ensure that the VA systems shall not be misused, and that the Philippines shall not be used for money laundering (ML), terrorist financing (TF) and proliferation financing (PF) activities. In addition,

5° Bangko Sentral-registered Virtual Currency Exchanges, as well as VASPs currently operating without Bangko Sentral approval, shall apply for a Certificate of Authority not later than three months from 10 February 2021. Upon submission of the application, said entities may continue to operate their business unless instructed otherwise.

All VASPs must also comply with the applicable requirements prescribed in this Section within six (6) months from 10

February 2021. Failure to comply with these requirements shall subject the entity to the appropriate enforcement action provided under Sec. OO1-N.

Annex A M-Regulations

VA transactions also pose other risks, such as information technology (IT) risks, consumer protection and financial stability concerns, among others.

Furthermore, the Bangko Sentral recognizes that once fiat currency is exchanged or converted into VA, it becomes easily transferrable, facilitating expedient movement or transfer of funds and payment services, among others. In this manner, VASPs are considered as money service businesses that are subject to the regulatory authority and examination powers of the Bangko Sentral under R. A. No. 7653, as amended by R. A. No. 11211.

This Section shall govern the operations and reporting obligations of VASPs in the Philippines.

The guidelines outlined in this Section are based on leading standards such as the Financial Action Task Force Recommendations on anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing standards, as well as other recognized risk management principles, and shall serve as Bangko Sentral's baseline requirement for all VASPs.

Requirements for issuance of Certificate of Authority (COA) A VASP shall secure a COA to operate as an MSB, pursuant to and upon compliance with the requirements under Section 102-M. In the course of COA application, the Bangko Sentral shall take into account and extend its evaluation over the fitness and propriety of the VASP's beneficial owners as defined under Section 904-Q of Part 9 of Q-Regulations.

mentioned violations/offenses, MSBs, and/or their directors, officers and/or employees may be imposed a maximum monetary penalty of ?1 million for each transactional violation or P100 thousand per calendar day for violations of a continuing nature as provided under Section 37 of R.A. No. 7653, as amended. Further, in case profit is gained or loss is avoided as a result of the violation, the Bangko Sentral may impose a fine of no more than three (3) times the profit gained or loss avoided on top of the aforementioned monetary penalty.

The Bangko Sentral considers the attendant circumstances of the case, including aggravating and mitigating factors, in the guided exercise of supervisory discretion to reach a reasonable and proportionate monetary penalty that best achieve the Bangko Sentral’s supervisory objectives.

However, the Bangko Sentral is not precluded from imposing non-monetary sanctions along with monetary penalties if circumstances so warrant.

b. Basis for the computation of the period or duration of penalty. The computation of the period or duration of all penalties shall be based on calendar days. For this purpose, the terms “per banking day”, “per business day”, “per day” and/or “a day” as used in this Manual, and other Bangko Sentral rules and regulations shall mean “per calendar day” and/or “calendar day” as the case may be.
